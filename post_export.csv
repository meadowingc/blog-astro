The interview itself was pretty short, only around 7 minutes or so. He talks about a variety of topics but there a specific thing he mentioned that I wanted to comment on here. I don't remember his exact words but it was something along the lines of:

> Humanities are disappearing. There's a lot of focus right now on the importance of kids (and adults) understanding science and engineering, and I think people sometimes forget that we created these in the first place for the humanities.

In other words: the goal should be to make our lives easier, not to replace the humanities.

There is a lot to be said here about how science is important but it's humanities that make life human, that make it worth living, but I wanted to constraint myself to talk about what the current LLM[^llm-meaning] phenomena is doing to humanity. These are being marketed more and more with the goal of making it easier for anyone to create stuff. But who is actually doing the creation? Is it the person who prompted the model to create that beautiful image? Is it the one who asked for a wonderful kids' bedtime story? 

I would say no. The creator is the model, of course. The users are just requesting what they want and the model generates it for them[^prompt-skills]. 

If we take a moment to look more deeply into this then it becomes obvious that, if we advance time a bet, what AI is evolving towards is a situation where humanity is offloading its *creative agency* to ""other beings"", and relegating itself exclusively to the role of consumer.

This ties back to Niel Gaiman's comment. These tools have a huge potential to help humanity be better but the way they're being (in their majority) sold to us is as a replacement of what it means to be human[^use-vs-research]. 

All the existing uses for LLMs and motivations people have for using them can be (mostly[^people-doing-nice-things]) boiled down to the fact that we're each trying to leverage this new technology to get *one-up* on each other, to be more productive, have more *social merit*, get ahead in the race.

Coming back to LLMs' role in replacing the human creative agent, I don't really think this will happen. Or at least not entirely. Humans have too much of a *creative spark* in them for all the peoples of the world to go along with this story. I would actually argue that — in a world where Netflix doesn't record their entertainment offerings beforehand but generates them on demand based on the viewer — the real, honest creations will be a premium commodity and will themselves be more appreciated than they are today.

In some way we're already seeing this shift with lots of people abandoning (entirely or in part) the use of centralized social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter, and instead preferring to keep a blog and follow a handful of other people, preferring the intimate over the impersonal. We're seeing a shift from quick-easy entertainment to valuing more the individual thoughts of other humans[^im-biased].

I imagine the internet user of the future will likely employ a mix of both. 

On one side they will have Netflix-LLM or some other monstrosity that generates content for them on-the-fly based on their mood and what they had for breakfast. This content will be 99.99% accurate to the tastes of the viewer and will be manufactured in such a way that it will evoke a certain emotion. This is more or less how movies work now, but producers have to consider the sensibilities of **a lot** of people at the same time. It's likely that this same kind of fast-food entertainment (fast-entertainment?) will also be available in shorter form (for example, a nightmarish *Reel-LLM™*). 

However, the people of the future will also have another form of content they consume which is directly made by other humans[^not-informational]. I imagine this kind of content will be long-form blogs much like the ones you can find on Bearblog.

Of course, other human created content (e.g. movies, books) is not really going anywhere. I imagine it will be sort of like owning handcrafted furniture vs IKEA stuff. The IKEA sofa is convenient and comfortable, but only the handcrafted will be considered art.


[^prompt-skills]: To be fair, there is a nontrivial amount of skill that's needed to make the model produce what you want. But I would say this is only temporary and will become less and less important as these models get smarter.
[^use-vs-research]: This comments apply mainly the way humans have thought of using this models and not about research (which can't be stopped, there will always be someone curious enough to go poke the weird slimy blob). 
[^people-doing-nice-things]: I should recognize that not everything is bad. There are some legitimately *nice* uses out there. Like having LLMs help people understand topics, or helping those that want to make art but are not able to do so for some reason. The line is blurry at best, and it's located in different places for different people.
[^not-informational]: And it won't be informational (as in *how to do X*) since LLMs will be better at explaining things using the best pedagogical strategy for each individual. These *human* posts will, by nature, be about human connection and ideas.
[^llm-meaning]: `LLM` stands for Large Language Model. They're a family of machine learning models that are especially good at dealing with language and manage to generate pretty good text. The most popular example, right now, is ChatGPT from OpenAI.
[^im-biased]: I'm most definitely biased on this, since I haven't done extensive research on the topic and the observation is limited to my personal experience and social sphere.",,,,,,2023-12-21T01:29:40.142013+00:00,7,0,91.49221909181769,False,False

I didn't really conclude anything and my mind has been thinking about it ever since, feeling as if somehow I left a loose end, itching to explore other possible avenues.

So, here we are!

I've been specifically thinking about where *inspiration* comes from, and where does it go to once it's gone. Inspiration as a phenomena is hardly logical, manifesting itself as a *fever* to do something. In my mind both *inspiration* and *dreams* have a similar flavor, so we'll start there.

---

There was a time when I was very disciplined about keeping a [dream journal](https://wordplay.bearblog.dev/on-keeping-dreams/). I learned early that to properly recall a dream one needs not try to remember the whole thing directly, instead one needs to identify and hold on to what I call a set of *hooks* that serve as fishing lines for the actual dream. These hooks can be anything from the dream that you feel it's important (sounds, sights, feelings, etc). 

When we wake up, our conscious mind tends to take our memories of the dream and reason about them, it *masticates* them into a reductive representation. But if instead we stop and try to individuate the hooks early on then we can later *pull* on those and have larger parts of the dream(s) unfold.

I could talk more about dreaming and dream journaling (and might actually make a post about it in the future since it's a fun topic), but I don't want to get distracted from what's important here: the *hooks*.

I feel the relationship between creating and inspiration is very similar to *pulling on a hook* and have the memory of a dream simply spill into your mind. When you're inspired things just flow, a torrent of ideas fighting to get out. In both cases you're opening a door into a part of your mind that's just full to the brim with *stuff* and, most importantly, that part is not directly accessible to your conscious/analytical mind, instead information flow just sort of happens by itself. 

Once inspiration is gone it is very hard to get it back (or at least it is for me). I wonder if there are also a set of *hooks* one can use to link *creator* and *muse*?

As an example: I'm a developer by profession, and I love to make programs. I also think there's a deeply creative aspect to it, ranging from how you structure everything to the solutions you apply to the problems that arise on your way. When programming, I **know** there's inspiration involved. However, there's an important difference with respect to writing: I'm able to leave a programming project and then come back to it many weeks later and quickly recover the inspiration. Why is that?

I think that for one there are a lot of things in programming on which the conscious analytical mind can munch on, which will invariably attract the attention of the intuitive subconscious (both will end up focused on the same task). There're also a lot of props involved, which work as *channelers* of attention. For example, each person has its own set of tools they like to use, code editors, and even their color schemes, keyboard layouts and shortcuts (and a myriad other things), all of which can be seen as artifacts whose goal is that of *helping to focus the inner eye*. We experience a sort of pleasure when working with them, and through pleasure we pull the focus of the whole mind unto the problem at hand.

I think one can find parallels to this in many other areas of human activity. 

Fortune tellers have their canonical misty ambiance, with a crystal ball or other similarly mystical object. In a meditation room decorations are usually pretty minimalistic, with a small altar or incense burner as the only focus of attention. Even writers have access to a plethora of rich papers, notebooks, pens, and even word processors. All of these have the goal of kindling a sense of **awe** in the person that's inhabiting these spaces, and our conscious analytical mind reacts to awe in the same way a moth to a candle: it can't help being drawn to it. 

Besides awe there's also the sensorial pleasure that these things bring. Both conspire to create the same effect: make the analytical mind focus on the *shiny things*, whilst at the same time creating a space for the now unencumbered subconscious to bubble up through the cracks. In other words: it inspires us (literally makes inspiration happen).

I think with writing, inspiration (aka excitement) is more fickle for me (than it is with say, programming) because things are usually more complex and I'm **way** less comfortable with my abilities (which is probably why I perceive it as more complex).

I frequently don't know where an idea will take me or what it is that I want to say until I write it down on the page. But *""the idea""* is often a very loose thing, it's more of a feeling actually. With programming I have code to work as a hook into excitement / inspiration. But how do you make hooks into a feeling?

Maybe you cannot. Maybe it's all just magic and one needs to take the opportunity when the flame burns. Still, I've found that by *doing*, and *taking the opportunity* as it arises, inspiration seems to be getting more and more frequent in my life.

Maybe it's also a matter of not getting in one's own way and trusting the process without a though for one's abilities or outcomes. After all, if I stop to think about it, that's exactly what I do when I jump into an old programming project I haven't worked with in a while.

I think a perhaps tentative conclusion is that *hooks* are there, and work exactly the same as when recalling a dream. The difference is that, with writing, they're all over the place and the trick is to learn to allow (and trust) oneself to see them.

Many of my past goals and wants, all seem so vain when measured against the ever changing-ness of the body, of life in general.

Right now I'm down with a stomach virus, feeling like a giant hand is repeatedly rinsing my insides against a washing board.

...

Social status is pointless. It's worth nothing and doesn't help one in any way. It's a completely aleatory way of measuring relative value. I've written about this before in [Hunting a Mammoth](/hunting-a-mammoth/), but basically it boils down to the fact that we as humans evolved to be like this in an environment which is very different from the one we live in nowadays.

Money is another. It has its uses of course, but at the end of the day there're diminishing returns once you have enough to ensure you can eat and have appropriate lodgings.

Whenever I'm sick like this it's like removing some glasses that were clouding my vision. Sure, it's all a very unpleasant process but I think it is necessary, it gives me a chance to see myself from another perspective, to reevaluate who I am.

Right now I'm thinking how grateful I'm with my mother-in-law who just brought me honeyed chamomile. And with my wife who is taking care of our son to allow me some time to get better.

I'm grateful with the fact I have this activity, writing, to both entertain me as well as allow me to see myself more clearly, and to make note of the things that are important.

It's so easy to lose track of what is really important. We go after *the next shiny thing* in a neverending stream of *shiny things*. Always thinking that once we get THE THING we'll finally, blessedly, be happy. We think our struggle will finally be finished.

But that's not how things work. In most cases the happiness we get from *the thing* is extremely short lived. In all cases we quickly move on to something else, sometimes even before we've completely finished doing the original thing in the first place!

I remember growing up I would always hear adults and media saying things like *a real man is a man with ambition*, or *those without ambition will amount to nothing in their lives*. I have to admit I fell (and fall) for this trap, thinking I **need** to have some ambition to move me forward.

But if I were to die today, would I be regretting the fact that I wasn't able to get that promotion I was aiming towards, or finish that side project I was so excited about? No. Those things will likely not cross my mind at all. If I'm lucky I will find myself being grateful about the things that really mattered to me like family and the small joys one finds everywhere, maybe even the fact that I've tried (and perhaps in some measure accomplished) to make others feel happier.

In other words, I will be thinking about the important things.

All of this has been said many times before. Often by better people than I. Why is it so hard for us to stop blindly going after the shiny things? Why is it so hard to always be mindful about what's really important to us?

I think that a major culprit here is that we tell to each other what things should we collectively deem as valuable.

So maybe an idea would be to not only tell ourselves that *X* is something that's really important, something we deeply care about, but act in such a way that it's clear for others that this is the case. Often I find I smooth out my outward facing likes and dislikes, to fit in better with those around me. Sometimes it's more extreme, and I find I tell myself that I like something I really don't care much for.

In other words, we should be more authentic with ourselves and with each other. Be brave enough to let go of the vain pursuits that society imposes upon us, and instead allow ourselves to be who we really are.

It was not exactly the same dream every time, but it always started and ended in the same way.

The dream would begin with me playing or just walking in some familiar place and suddenly I would notice that there was a pale, raven-haired girl watching me[^creepy]. She was always dressed all in black, wearing a dress or a skirt. She never said a word, but had a wonderful smile she wore often. Her hair was true-raven-black, long, straight, and lose. 

[^creepy]: In retrospect I see how this can sound a bit creepy but at the time the thought never crossed my mind. In the dream I knew she was my friend and that she wanted to play with me. I never got anything but positive feelings from her. 

She would gesture for me to follow and we would both turn into ravens and fly to her house through a conveniently positioned window nearby. This was a power she had, transforming us into ravens. Her house wasn't really in any place, and I knew it was impossible to get there except in raven form. The house was surrounded on all sides by a wall of thorns and dead trees. 

We would land in front of the door to her house, a Gothic mansion with sprawling gardens all around. The garden wasn't what you would call *green* or *lush*. It was a *dry garden*. Mainly bushes, weather-worn statues, and a winding gravel path we would spend an immensurable amount of time in. In spite of this it felt very much alive, and had its own definite personality, with the water smoothed surface of the statues giving it an air of magic and mischief. 

She had a butler who was always there waiting to receive us outside the front door of the mansion. The butler was the only other person I ever saw and, while afflicted with permanent seriousness, he was kind and looked out for us. Once he saw we were ok he would nod and disappear inside the mansion to perform his butlery duties.

I remember that everything around her house had a greyish tinge, sort of like a black and white movie but not quite so extreme. However, I never perceived things around me as gloomy. On the contrary, it was a magical place full of mysteries to explore, and nooks to hide in.

We spent most, if not all, of our time in her huge garden. Running around, playing the kind of small games that children invent to amuse themselves, or just sitting in some place out of the way seeing how the wind rustled the grass. I used to speak to her sometimes about thing that were happening in my real life, or ideas for games, or just small stuff as children often do. I have the feeling she didn't like it very much when I spoke about my waking life, but maybe that's just older me projecting stuff onto my memories.

At some point, she would get up and I would know it was time to go back. We would turn into ravens once more and fly back to my home but she would not stay with me. She would fly away to her own world, and I would wake up.

I haven't thought about her in a while. I wonder what she's doing now. I hope she's happy.

I don't know what prompted me to write about this. Maybe it was because yesterday I dreamt I was in a big city, and I saw a raven-haired woman walking next to me. I didn't know who she was but I knew we were walking together, and I was glad of her company. I remember feeling bad I had to leave her soon because I had to wake up and go to work. 

It might not have been the same *persona*, or maybe yes. Regardless, I'm glad to revisit these happy memories. Hopefully writing about her here will give her a new home to live in, and who knows, maybe she'll get to meet some other people and visit their dreams from time to time.

Surprisingly, I'm more anxious about this trip than seems reasonable, and I'm not sure why. It's not the first time I've traveled, nor is it even the first time I've gone to Seattle for work. It's actually the second time I'm going there. Now that I think about it, I can see how the first time was kind of *traumatizing* in some ways. Perhaps talking about it would help me work through it.

Let's start from the beginning...

Last time I went, I flew from my country to Mexico City, and then from there to Seattle. I took the same route on the way back. Overall, it was fairly quick and was by far the best option offered by the travel agency that the company I work for uses (all the other routes were waaay longer or had a lot more *legs*).

My way there was... ok. The flight itself was great, but Mexico City's airport was chock-full of people. I had trouble finding a place to sit down, so I took advantage of the situation and put on an audiobook while I walked around the airport looking for a nice place to sit. After a while, I was extremely lucky to stumble upon one of the nicest and most delicious Mexican restaurants I've ever been to: [Vuela Carmela](https://www.instagram.com/vuela.carmela) (you should definitely check it out if you find yourself in MEX). 

*Vuela Carmela* became my haven for the four hours or so I still had to wait. I sat down to read a book while I drank some cappuccinos and had something to eat. Despite the airport being quite full (as I mentioned before), the restaurant was fairly empty, and the waiters were very friendly and happy to chat. 

![delicious Mexican food](https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/meadow-1714782449-0.png)

I was happy that I would fly through Mexico on my way back so I could try something new from the menu. I only had a two hour layover on my way back though... Or at least that's what I thought, but I was very mistaken.

... The flight to Seattle went fine, work stuff happened and was fine ...

Then came the time to go back home. Once I arrived at the MEX airport again, I was completely baffled by the astronomical, incomprehensible, mind-boggling number of people who were delayed there due to the [Popocatépetl volcano erupting](https://web.archive.org/web/20230930082230/https://volcano.si.edu/showreport.cfm?wvar=GVP.WVAR20230517-341090). We're talking about people sleeping in the corridors, near the bathrooms, everywhere... Though perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.

While in the taxi on my way to the Seattle airport, the news broadcast from the radio was saying something about an eruption somewhere, but I was paying little attention; still groggy with sleep and not having yet had my morning coffee. It turns out that Mexico City is really close (as in 70 km/43 miles close) to the Popocatépetl volcano, which had decided that was the right time to start erupting a shit-ton of smoke and ashes. This, of course, is not good for airplanes, so all flights were grounded for two days. I got there at the beginning of day one.

Fast forward to when I landed in MEX. 

At the time, I was completely oblivious to what was happening. I instead checked the flights board and saw that my assigned gate had not yet been posted but the flight read ""ON TIME"", so all was good. I went to have lunch at *Vuela Carmela*, where I met the same waiter from last time. I stayed there a bit and then went to check the flights board again. Now my gate was posted, so I made my way there.

... I was actually going to talk in detail about everything that happened, but perhaps we can just summarize it by saying that the flight kept being delayed, delayed, delayed, delayed. It was marked as canceled almost 12 hours after its expected departure time.

By this time, it was already quite late (11pm or so), and I think I was just too dazed to think much about what was happening, so I just went along with the flow.

Some people from Aeromexico (the airline I was traveling with) came to tell us we should make our way to the Aeromexico counters so they could issue a new ticket for the next day. It sounded pretty simple in principle, but remember the *mind-boggling* amount of people I mentioned before? Well, MEX is served in it's great majority by Aeromexico flights, meaning that almost all of them ended up in the queue with me! 

I kid you not when I say the ""queue"" (if such a thing could be called that) went from the inner counters of Aeromexico, through airport, outside, turned the corner, and far off into the drop-off area on the street. But this still didn't deter my optimism. I stood there, almost half a mile from my goal that was the counter, thinking it would probably take just a couple of hours. Oh silly me.

What followed were almost six or so hours, just standing there, moving very very slowly. I made some friends, a couple of Mexican people standing behind me, some folks who were actually meant to board my same flight back home, a polish kid and his mother. As time dragged its leaden feet, people would spontaneously leave the queue. The smart ones left with the goal of coming back later when there were fewer people, while the ones beaten by the queue left in despair to try and talk to someone. At the same time, new people came in, a constant flux while we all moved together as one.

Honestly, my memories of what happened during this time are very fuzzy. I remember that for a while I listened to my trusty audiobook, then read a bit, then wrote a bit in a notebook I was carrying. 

I remember there was a lady in front of me who kept looking back at me. I smiled at her a couple of times, hopefully in a friendly and commiserating way. We never spoke though. At one point she caught my eye and made as if to speak to me and, in a panic, I *literally* hid myself behind my notebook (as in raising it up to my face).

I still remember feeling the heat on my face as I saw her from the corner of my eye, just staring at me with her mouth open, an expression of disbelief on her face (or that's how I remember it at least). I felt bad about this later, she didn't deserve my childish behavior. I wanted to apologize, but shortly after I had decided this was the right thing to do, she left the queue; a friend she was with had come to get her saying they should go and buy new ticket with another airline instead of waiting for who knows how many more hours. I guess I'll never get to say sorry. I didn't mean it, didn't mean anything by it. My mind was just not working properly.

The remaining hours went by, inexorably. As the Aeromexico counter came into view, I found myself among a nice group of people. I wouldn't really say *friends* but the silent hours together had molded us into some kind of *group*, hammered us into a sort of support system. By this time, it was around 5 am, and TV cameras started to come in to film the large number of people — the queue was still as big as ever, with new planes landing all the while and feeding its insatiable hunger. One of the people I was with, a Mexican guy who was on his way to visit his son somewhere to the south, was actually interviewed by one of the major local news channels (I appeared in the background and waved at the camera, but they'll probably cut that part out if they air it at all).

Eventually, we got to the counter, and at that precise moment our group *disbanded*. I feel kind of bad that everyone in the group exchanged phone numbers except for me. I had many chances to offer my number or ask theirs, but I just... didn't. Perhaps something to explore in a future post.

It was around 10 am when I was almost right at the Aeromexico counter. I could've sworn I saw a dear ex-coworker standing a couple of people away right in front of me. I didn't see her face but she was the same height, same build, and had the same *true raven black* hair. I wanted to call out to her, but (again) didn't. I spent my remaining time at the airport that day looking for her, but of course, I did not see her again. 

Finally. Finally I got to the counter and got to speak to a very friendly lady from Aeromexico who printed me a new boarding ticket for a flight that was leaving the next morning (on day number three). I was already very tired so I took a shuttle to one of those generic airport hotels and slept. I got at the hotel I think around 11 am (after sorting everything out at the airport) and set an alarm to wake me up for dinner. I slept right through and woke up at 5am the next morning feeling completely refreshed, in time to take the shuttle back for my flight.

The rest of the story went fairly well. I had breakfast at *Vuela Carmela* once again before finally boarding my flight home.

So... it seems I did have some stuff to work through, especially around the memories of ""the queue"". It's funny, but while writing about that part, I almost felt my mind slipping into that same hypnotic, sleepless state.

The good news about this new trip to Seattle is that **I won't** be going through Mexico. Even if I wanted to, the travel agency didn't give me Mexico as a layover option.

I sometimes admonish myself for not feeling joyful. Sometimes I also *don't create* if I'm feeling down because I feel like whatever comes out won't be as good[^to-be-fair]. Here I'm mainly thinking in the context of writing.

As I've mentioned in [a previous post](/talent-feeds-on-persistence/), lately I've been watching the [10 Years with Hayao Miyazaki](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/ondemand/program/video/10yearshayaomiyazaki/) documentary. I think we can all agree that his stories are genius, inspiring, and all-around wonderful. He's possibly one of the best storytellers in our modern world, and definitely one of the ones I like most.

Prior to watching the documentary I always assumed he was a happy person. I thought he must be in order to be able to create such wondrous worlds, such moving stories.

Well, it turns out I was mistaken. He's not *miserable-always-depressed*, but in the documentary we definitely see him having some ups and downs. He's mostly a grumpy person, and many times in the documentary he states that he has a hard time being happy in his daily life.

*How then can he create with such beauty?* I thought. My original assumption that sublime creation can only occur when one is happy was mistaken, of course. I think that all his bad experiences, and his general sadness about the world, are themselves his most important qualities. They're the things from which he draws forth the need to prove to others (and maybe to himself) that being alive is beautiful. What I would consider to be his *bad parts* (such an inappropriate word, *bad*) are his *compost heap* with which he nurtures his ideas and dreams, and then shares them for all to partake in.

*""Yet, even amidst the hatred and carnage, life is still worth living. It is possible for wonderful encounters and beautiful things to exist""* he says in one of the episodes while talking about why he makes movies. Another was *""I would like to make a film to tell children ""it's good to be alive""*. 

This idea of having a *wholesome* kind of entertainments is something that he keeps going back to again and again throughout the documentary (perhaps this is strongly related to what he says about there being [no sense in creating something without a soul](/there-is-no-sense-in-making-something-without-a-soul/)?).

Anyway, while the above is all pure conjecture, this way of looking at one of my favorite storytellers is definitely positive for me. If he can use his sadness to create, then so can I, so can we all. There's no need to beat myself up about how I feel, there is wisdom to be found everywhere if one allows oneself to look for it. And more importantly: it is ok to be sad sometimes.

I don't know why but I've always had this feeling that if I work hard there might eventually come a day when I will no longer experience sadness, when my days will be full of joy and happiness. It's sobering to think that this is most likely never going to happen. Of course, I can deal with my insecurities, fears, and whatnot, and in general grow and become a better person, but I'll never live in a stream of constant happiness. I would venture to say that no human ever will. And that's ok.

Funny writing this down. I feel like I'm seeing something that has been in front of me for a long time. So close that I didn't see it in fact. 

Accepting this is liberating. It means that the feeling I have that I need to first attain this state of everlasting-happiness to be able to live my best life, to do the things I want to do, that feeling is not to be listened to. Instead, I can do everything right now, accepting who I am right now, and also accepting that things are in constant change / growth. 

Putting your life on hold while waiting to be a *better* version of yourself is limiting to your present self, and directly prevents you from being that better self you want to be.

Whew. Sorry for the digression there.

I was looking a bit online and found many people have posted screenshots of the *10 Year with Hayao Miyazaki* documentary, many of which highlight how sometimes he's unhappy and that's ok. 

I'm sharing some of them here ([taken from this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/13nu8e8/quotes_by_hayao_miyazaki_cofounder_of_studio/)). I want to stress that these might bias you into thinking he's a chronically depressed person, I don't think he is. Instead, I think he's a *well balanced* person.

~ Take care, and remember to be kind to yourself 🌈

[^to-be-fair]: To be fair, I do *create* other kinds of things, like monologues, but these are more conversations with myself than actual creations.

I've always been intrigued by it but for some reason I've never tried it, even though I've read that it has been a really useful practice for multiple people. After reading some new posts about it (one of them from [tiramisu](https://tiramisu.bearblog.dev/sit-and-hurt/)) I've decided it's finally time for me to give it a try!

The idea of *Morning Pages* was originally proposed by *Julia Cameron* and consists of sitting down every morning and writing three pages of text. As far as I understand it doesn't matter what you write about as long as you just **write**. The suggestion is to put things down in a sort of stream-of-conscious style.

A quick search on the internet reveals that *three pages* are *750 words*, but [another page](https://juliacameronlive.com/2012/09/20/morning-pages-why-3-pages/) — by Julia Cameron herself — says one should write three *8.5x11* pages, which as far as I could understand is the same as an *A4* page. I'm not an expert, but I think that I can fit many more than *750* words in *3xA4* pages. I guess it would be easy to find out if I took the time.

Anyway, I'll stick to the 750 words mark since I feel it's good amount and I know I can comfortably reach it within an acceptable amount of time. Another thing Julia Cameron says is to make sure to do them in the morning — hence the name. This might be a bit of an issue for me considering I have a small baby with which I want to play with in the morning before work. 

The exercise itself — I think — is not that of just writing crap, which I can easily do [in my own work notes](/on-work-journaling-and-authentic-writing/) (in which I often write much more than 750 words a day). It's more that of just learning to sit with your stream of consciousness, learn how *not to get in the way* and in so doing get to know yourself. It's going to be interesting and hopefully I can stick with it. I also won't be doing *longform writing* because — even though I love to write with pen and paper — it is much slower AND I like the idea that whatever I make gets backed up in a digital medium, it feels safer somehow[^safer-digital]. 

I think I'll write these notes mainly to myself. I kind of have the *itch* to write them in such a way that, if it is interesting, I can post it to my blog. But I don't think that will set the proper tone for me, since I'll try to — subtly — veer towards making *publishable* content. That is, it will likely impact how deep I'm willing to dig. On the other hand, that's exactly why I started blogging, as a motivation to write more and maybe share some of the stuff I feel. We'll see, I guess it's too soon to make a decision so I'll just do whatever feels right in the moment.

[^safer-digital]: Even though my news-feed has been showing me lots of news about how a solar storm (that is expected to happen once every 100 years) could wipe out electronics (or will it just shut down the internet?) for a couple of months, so writing in an actual paper notebook is probably safer? Anyway, I don't expect anyone to read these notes, and I would also be surprised if I revisit them myself, so maybe the decision itself doesn't matter much.

It all started when I stumbled upon [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/)[^draves-steam], a game where you control a group of dwarves and your goal is that of having them thrive by building production and economical systems, all through a simple text-only UI. It's more or less similar to other *Real-Time Strategy* games like the popular *Age of Empires*, but the depth of the simulation is breathtaking (and the goal of the game is not to win, but to [have fun](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Losing)).

I think this was one of the first things that actually drew me to this game. As a fledgling programmer I was (and still am) completely awestruck[^attain-nirvana] by how every tiny bit of the world has rules that govern it: from the flow of liquids in a three dimensional block world to the internal feelings of the dwarves, to the worms and newts scurrying around your map, all of them with their own motivations and procedures for accomplishing them.

I quickly started to appreciate the effects that the text-only interface was having, both for me as well as for the developers. For me, once I learned to understand what every glyph meant[^using-tilesets], it allowed my imagination to fill in the blanks between the simple representation of the entities, picturing the action in my mind's eye as it happened, being able to visualize complex engineering contraptions used to pump lava into a lava pit, or drunken cats having kittens and causing a [catsplosion](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/v0.31:Catsplosion).

The appreciation for the developer-side of text interfaces didn't come until I started to play around with making similar games myself. Nice graphics are nice, but creating them is extremely time consuming, especially for a perfectionist like myself. Using simple text frees you completely from having to worry about creating sprites for everything in your game, and instead allows you to focus on the actual mechanics and gameplay. Sure, there's still quite a bit of design involved since the graphical limitations also mean you need to put in extra effort into making sure the game is understandable to players, but overall you can trust that they know what you mean. Sort of like writing a book without adding pictures.

After spending some time with Dwarf Fortress I started looking for other similar games that would afford a similar level of immersion. I discovered there are many many such games, but the one that probably had the most impact on me was a *little* game called [NetHack](https://www.nethack.org).

Behind the deceptively simple text UI NetHack hides a fiendishly complex set of behaviors and strategies necessary to beat the game. I don't remember where I read it but it is said that *if you can imagine doing something then there's probably a way to do it in NetHack*.

I remember once, when I was first learning how to progress in the game, I was (unwisely) playing in a statistics lecture. I met a goblin mother (or maybe it was a kobold?) and her son. I talked to the mother who told me she and her son were living there, and then I tried talking to the son. To my dismay instead of talking I attacked and killed the poor young goblin. Not knowing what else to do and curious about what would happen I went ahead and *ate* the corpse since I thought it would help me recover some health (I'm a monster, I know). To my surprise once I did this the mother started crying and hitting me, telling me I was *a monster*. I did not expect this complex chain of cause and effect to happen. I guffawed at the absurdity of what had happened, causing the whole lecture room to silently stare at me for a good 10 seconds.

And this is what I think is the best thing about ASCII games. The flexibility they afford is just unparalleled, using the graphics engine of the player's imagination. It is possible to attain such flexibility in *traditional* games where there is a sprite for every possible state of every entity, but it requires a lot more effort. 

When looking at yourself (the player) in an ASCII games you will see a `@`, but you'll know in your mind's eye what kind of armor you're wearing, what *race* you're, whether you're missing an arm or not. All transmitted by the lowly `@`.

[^draves-steam]: Dwarf Fortress has recently had a [Steam release](https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/) that includes proper tile graphics and better menus. I bought it to support the creators but haven't really played it yet!
[^attain-nirvana]: One of my dreams has always been that of taking a peek at the codebase and, in so doing, attain nirvana.
[^ascii-meaning]: [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) stands for *American Standard Code for Information Interchange*, and basically defines a set of *characters* that computers know how to work with (mainly alphanumeric characters and a few symbols). Even though *ASCII game* have *ASCII* in the name, they usually use a larger set of characters (e.g. [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)) that describe more symbols, and as such offer more freedom when designing graphical elements.
[^using-tilesets]: To be fair, I also cheated a bit since it is possible to play vanilla Dwarf Fortress with tilesets that make it much easier to know what every cell of the map contains.

I think with the blog it started when I upgraded my account. I did so mainly because I really liked the platform and wanted to support it. Once I upgraded I noticed the *very fancy* analytics tab. 

I clicked on it — while aware of my peril, alas I thought I could handle it — out of curiosity to see who was linking to my posts. This then kept me coming back, exploring more of the interface, until eventually I realized I was no longer writing anything. 

And here we are. I wish there was a way to maybe disable the *analytics tab*, or maybe add a warning saying *abandon all hope ye who enter here* — all *hope* to create things *honestly* that is.

On my browser I have a very nifty extension called [Lor-Saba/Code-Injector: WebExtension (github.com)](https://github.com/Lor-Saba/Code-Injector) which allows me to execute custom Javascript or CSS on any page I visit. I can add a CSS rule for `https://bearblog.dev/dashboard/` with the following CSS that will just hide the `Analytics` link.

```css
a[href=""/dashboard/analytics/""] {
	display: none;
}
```

While this does work — I've already added it — it feels a bit like hiding my head in the sand, like an ostrich. Although it's probably not that bad, at least — supposing I manage to find motivation once again — it will allow me not to get side-tracked with switching goals and external pressures.

Edit. Just [discovered](https://docs.bearblog.dev/neat-bear-features/) that Bear allows you to add custom Dashboard CSS directly! So there is no real need to use an external browser plugin. This also has the added benefit that the styles work when viewing your dashboard on devices that don't have the plugin (e.g. your phone).

It's nice having them here, a bit chaotic but there's a lot of love going around. After a while their stay starts being a bit uncomfortable, but for now all is good. 

My son (~2 years old) is having lots of fun playing with his cousins, which is an extra bonus. I'm really happy that they get along so well. I wonder if it will stay like this forever (hopefully yes), or if it will be like it was for me and my cousins where we got along really well when we were kids but there came a point when we just stopped talking. I don't know anything about their current lives, and it has been years since I cared to check what they were up to. I guess the fault is on both parts.

To be fair with them (and with me) I did move far away when I was little. I'm talking about more than a 10 hours flight; another continent. Our parents did what they could to make us play when we went back to my original country, but they can only do so much. Eventually the *baton* passed to us, the new generation, and we just dropped it. That's what happens when you're living different lives I guess.

I know I could pursue a *superficial relationship* with them, like sending them funny gifs or whatnot on social media. The problem is that (1) I don't really use any social media, and (2) I'm not sure if this is better than any other kind of shallow connection like sending them a happy birthday message once a year.

I have a brother and he does keep up with most of our cousins through social media — mainly Instagram. As he tells it they don't really talk *with words* but instead just send each other funny stuff. I guess that is a good way to at least keep some sort of rapport with someone, at least create a channel that allows each one of you to tell the other person that you're thinking about them in a noncommittal way. 

To this end I've tried (a couple of times) to get into the habit of using Instagram. I've told myself I can start small and send stuff to my closest friends, then build up to ones I haven't spoken to in a while, and eventually to childhood friends and my cousins. This works well for a couple of weeks but eventually I find my mental health suffers so I abandon my efforts. 

I don't know if it happens for other people (I guess not for most) but after spending some time on *any* social media (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and even Mastodon) I end up feeling dirty, like my mind is heavy, my spirit somehow tainted by the experience. I make an effort of just following accounts that post *nice* and *funny* things, or *poetry* and *art*, but still it happens. 

I think it has something to do with consuming *lots* of *short-form* content. Maybe the constant context switching is something I don't enjoy, and the uncomfortableness of it just builds up, and up, and up. And when I close the app I realize I feel bad, almost nauseous, sometimes I feel like I even *hate* myself for spending so much time on it (although *hate might* too strong of a word).

Who knows. It's also very likely that all of the above is not true at all and I'm just sub-consciously judging my actions because I'm comparing them against a *gold standard* which tells me that (corporate) social media is evil and should be avoided at all costs.

Anyway, sorry for the rant here. I think I'll make an effort to *think* some more on how to recover some of those lost connections I've let slip in my life. Hopefully I can find a middle-ground between being pen-pals and being *intimate strangers* on Instagram.

Even if I can't place many of the songs, they're still a nice thing to listen to while working. 

Yesterday I noticed there's been an idea floating around my mind ever since I saw the third (or maybe the second) episode of [10 Years with Hayao Miyazaki](https://archive.org/details/10-years-with-hayao-miyazaki), and is something that really comes to life in Hisaishi's music. 

The episode in question covers the creation of [From Up on Poppy Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Up_on_Poppy_Hill), a movie that Miyazaki's own son (Goro Miyazaki) was directing, something to which the elder Miyazaki was opposed, saying his son didn't have the determination to be a movie director. 

Anyway, at one point he was reviewing some concept art that one of the animators was doing for his son and, after starting at the drawing for a bit, declared that it *had no soul*, no vigor, no life. He said (paraphrasing because I couldn't find the quote online and I'm too lazy to rewatch the episode):

> There is no reason in making something without a soul, you might as well not do it.

The poor animator, of course, didn't know where to hide. But it wasn't really his fault, the movie's character had no soul at that point, it's true. It's only after this scathing comment that Goro re-envisioned the character to become it's final form.

This short critique has been pretty impactful to me as I'm thinking about what to do, where to head to if I were to live a more creative life. There is no sense in making anything that doesn't have a soul, not if you aspire to inspire others, to bring them joy and entertain. 

The lesson is, I think, to dig deep, and then dig deeper. Characters / stories should have dreams of their own, sometimes unbeknownst to the writer. Still, they have the responsibility of giving them space to come forth and guide their pen.

Thinking back on Miyazaki's films, I can see this idea permeating everything from the characters to the environments. It's so pervasive that it's hard to point out, but it is definitely one (if not THE one) quality that sets it apart from every other kind of film. It's this that makes his stories feel so alive, so relatable, so easy to get lost into, no matter how magical and impossible are the things they portray.

With all of this I don't mean to criticize my past *work*, nor my future one, nor any other person's creative work. I think that one needs to take care to not do the inverse, of worrying so much about things having *a soul* that we end up not creating anything. It's better to create, freely, and in so doing we shed light on those dark corners, and get ever closer and closer to being able to *create with a soul*.

> Whenever someone creates something with all of their heart, then that creation is given a soul.

But then I reminded myself that while I enjoy writing for others, and enjoy the idea of fame and whathaveyou, that is not my goal. I don't want that to be my goal; I refuse for it to be. My goal is just that of doing something I enjoy. Of writing, and in the process get to know myself better, to allow [change](https://lili.bearblog.dev/if-writing-changes-me-let-it-change-me-for-the-better/), and improve at something I like.

I asked myself, *""who am I writing for?""*. As part of my process I went online to see if anyone else had written anything about this topic and found one post in particular that resonated with me: a [post by Mathina Calliope](https://www.mathinacalliope.com/blog/2018/1/30/who-are-you-writing-for). She says that there are three different categories of writers, differentiated by their motivations. Quote:

> 1. self-expression and creative fulfillment 
> 2. sharing information, entertainment, and/or inspiration
> 3. calling readers to action (e.g. political, spiritual, commercial)

All my previous attempts at keeping a blog fell squarely on the second point (mainly informative or wannabe-philosophical posts), and they didn't go very well. I found my motivation quickly plummeted and I was getting little satisfaction out of the content I was creating. 

I think I had the misfortune of coming up in a marketing world, and as such my blogs were that kind of blog trying to make interesting content with the goal of getting more visitors. They didn't have a soul. I think I didn't really know why I was doing it and ended up using completely the wrong motivation. 

It wasn't until I stumbled on Bearblog, and especially on the blogs of [tiramisu](https://tiramisu.bearblog.dev/) and [eve](https://reverie.bearblog.dev/journal/), that my eyes were opened to the fact there is another kinds of blogging, ones in which there is no real outcome besides self expression.

This blog is different. It is true I think of a subset of people when I write, I have a *platonic audience* so to say, which more or less modulates my voice and the amount of detail I go into. But it is very different than anything I've done before in that this is done mainly for myself. Except for the first few posts I did, I try not to care about what I'll write, I just write it and then publish it. Sometimes what I publish is useful to others, sometimes it's *deep*, sometimes it's extremely superficial. I try not to care.

Anyway, coming back to Mathina's post, shortly after these categories she answers my question quite directly. 

> ... we write to connect. We have something to say and want others to hear it.

It is somewhat contradictory to what I've been saying but it has the *ring of truth to my ears*. If I were only writing (entirely) for myself then I wouldn't bother with having a blog at all. I wouldn't make the effort in posting these ramblings online. The true reason I'm writing is, as Mathina says, to connect with others. I know I have things I want to say, I feel a pressure inside me wanting to get these things out. I don't know what these are yet, but that's why I write. To uncover, and hopefully in the process to connect with others.

In some way it's a twisted exercise in self-gratification, but that doesn't mean it's worthless. I sometimes feel like a stone caked with mud and clay, and my job with these pages is to slowly chip away the clay, wash the mud with a river of ink, to finally uncover the lumpy, weirdly-shaped stone inside. What I'll do with it once I've set it free? I don't know. Maybe show it to others?

**Warning:** there are minor spoilers ahead for the movie Inside Out.

___

Yesterday I re-watched Pixar's *Inside Out* movie with my wife and in-laws, and — as always — I was impressed by how invested I was in it. Especially near the end, you have a whole lot of emotion going on, while the story itself takes you through the process where the protagonist (Joy) learns that Sadness is important. Somehow, the emotion evoked at this point is exactly that: a mix of sadness and joy. Sad for the way Sadness had been treated, for the kid Reilly who is leaving her home. Joy for the hope on the horizon, for the understanding and realization that has just happened. 

It reminded me very much of something that Niel Gaiman touched on in his masterclass, in one of the first few episodes named something like *""Honesty in Fiction""*. He says that, with storytelling, you're basically telling an elaborate lie to people and while people are good at ""suspending their disbelief"" they won't connect with the story unless there is an emotional *something* that stirs up feelings in them. Emotions are like the seasoning of the story that differentiates synthetic industrialized food from a feast of homegrown produce. 

The *honesty* part comes from the fact that for him (and I think pretty much for everyone) it's impossible to add *emotion* to a story unless that emotion comes from somewhere inside oneself. In this *episode* he mentioned multiple times the advice that one needs to *open up more than one would usually be comfortable with*. 

The movie, being about emotions, is a good candidate for *expressing* emotional topics. But really, this can be done with whatever topic one chooses. The themes themselves that are treated in the movie are not specific to abstract things, they're actually very much everyday human things. The theme of being happy with something and then losing it for reasons outside of one's own control. The theme of not appreciating something and then realizing that it was actually a great thing to begin with. The complementary theme of feeling not appreciated, and then realizing one's own value and being able to contribute to the world. The crushing theme of letting go, and being let go of, of wanting someone but that other not reciprocating the feeling — not with malice, just because they don't think about you anymore.

Anyway, suffice it to say that it was a great *study* in what things other people are doing that work *for me*. A chance to appreciate the importance of *emotion* in storytelling.

I don't know about others but for me a great story is mainly great because of how it's written and not so much for the idea behind it. If you have an awesome idea with a bad execution then the story will be hard to connect with. But you can have a mediocre plot with a great execution and the resulting story will be great. What differentiates a good execution from a bad one is how *human* the story ends up being, how much we end up emotionally connecting with it.

Lately I've been hesitating with regards to what to publish; I have many drafts that I'm no longer excited about but I still feel like I should publish before moving on to *more exciting stuff*.

I have this idea, this notion, of what my blog's narrative is and I'm trying to *continue* that narrative in a consistent way. But yesterday I realized that maybe I no longer want to continue that narrative! 

I've been thinking about this issue for a while now. The idea that, as bloggers, we grow and change and how I'm no longer the person I was one month ago, and even less the one I was 4 months ago. My resolution was that it's ok to feel this way and it's fine that what I want to write about now no longer matches the style or content of the things I wrote in the past. One should allow oneself to evolve, and accept one's own blog as a reflection of this change.

But this is only about *going forward*, about things I haven't written yet. What I failed to consider was the gray area, the half-written posts waiting to be reviewed, those *almost finished* drafts that my past self deemed good enough and was intending to publish in the near future but never got around to it. Right now I have 23 drafts which are basically all almost-finished posts and only need some minor revision. 

The way in which I write is that I sit down every day and just *write* about something, whatever is on my mind. Occasionally there's a part of what I put down that I feel is good and that I could post on my blog, so I copy the text and make a new file in my ""drafts"" folder. Every once in a while I go back to this folder and choose a draft that calls to me, clean it up, and publish it. When choosing what to publish I try to preserve some sort of internal consistency with respect to my existing blog posts so that I don't put out something that references a detail I mentioned in a yet unpublished draft.

This method has worked fine for now, but the speed at which I add new drafts is faster than the one at which I publish them (writing is of course more fun than editing) so I'm now at the point where I hardly remember what I was thinking (let alone *feeling*) when I wrote the older drafts. Moreover, I no longer feel like I want to publish all of those older ones since I've changed and so have my interests.

I tell myself I should still publish these drafts in order since they tell a coherent story and I want to paint as complete a picture as possible. But I feel this has been keeping me back from really enjoying the act of publishing, and (more importantly) from growing and branching out into other stuff. I now see tackling most of these drafts as a chore, one which I frequently procrastinate on. 

I said that these are almost finished posts, but they still require quite a bit of work to clean up, reorder text, cut out stuff, add new stuff, etc, and I don't find myself really enjoying this part that much unless I'm excited about the post I'm in the process of cleaning up. 

So, I've decided I will do a ""spring cleaning"" of my drafts folder. I will apply the [Marie Kondo](https://web.archive.org/web/20240326160430/https://konmari.com/about-the-konmari-method/) method of cleaning up and just archive all drafts that *""don't spark a sense or joy""* or some other emotion. I don't believe in deleting stuff though, so who knows, maybe these archived drafts will eventually find their way to my blog at some point.

I think that, going forward, I should strive to publish possibly on the same day or week in which I write something[^dointend]. Honestly, this *drafts* folder has been weighing on my mind as clutter and I'm glad (even happy) that I've accepted I don't need to deal with it.

... 🍵 ...

Soon after I started my blog, [Eve](https://reverie.bearblog.dev/) sent me a really nice email and in it she mentioned an advice I sadly tend to forget[^forgetinsights], but I try to frequently come back to it.

> Sometimes I have to sit down and remind myself that there are no rules for what I post & I can change the game at any time! 

I tend to *solidify* around these imaginary rules and suffer for it. It's good to remind oneself that your blog is *your* space and you can really do whatever you want with it, there're no rules.

Kneel, mortal, and know your peril. Are you seeking passage to the tomb of Tantemoh the Third? If so, know that you must pass by me. Speak now.""

""Wait. 'Asphirinx' you said? I thought this was the Sphinx's chamber"" said the explorer, all grimy from spending three days drudging through the ancient tombs ""damn, I must have taken a wrong turn"" he said to himself.

""Ah! Tell me not about that treacherous fiend!"" spit the Asphirinx ""why would you want her anyway? Neither wisdom nor riches does she impart, only death, and her bloody riddles"".

For as long as he could remember he'd dreamt of the sacred city every night without fault. At first he didn't know what the dreams meant, but growing up as the son of a historian he soon found out that his dreams pointed to a real place, one he thought he was destined to find. Since then, he had spent all his life looking for it, looking for answers. 

""All my research says that the Sphinx of Tehndor guards the entrance to the sacred city, isn't that so? That's what I'm after, and I'm prepared to bargain my life to reach it"" said the explorer. 

This was his last chance. All his worldly possessions had gone into financing this trip.

The Asphirinx sighed and lay on her haunches with her head held high.

""So you have hopes of answering my cousin's riddles eh? That's because you don't know the kind of questions she asks."" said the Asphirinx ""and her power to bar entrances is the worst. Do you know what she did at our family dinner during the last opening-of-the-year festival? She bloody stood there and said no one could pass into the dining room until they answered what she's got in her pocket! She doesn't even have pants!""

""Errr..."" said the explorer, now confused. The conversation had take a decidedly unexpected turn. It didn't seem wise to interrupt though.

""And then you know what she did? She bloody turned and bloody ate the whole bloody dinner all by herself, leaving nothing for the rest of us!"" it seemed she was getting into the groove now ""You would think she would be satiated with all those handsome explorers such as yourself that she's gobbling up all the time. Do you know when it was the last time I ate someone?""

The explorer deemed it wise to change topics. Talking about eating people was not something he thought smart to engage in with a person-eating creature.

""So.. why do they call you Asphirinx anyway? You seem very much like what I would expect a Sphinx to look like"" he said tentatively. And with surprise noticed that the Asphirinx seemed pleased by the comment.

""Ah.."" said the Asphirinx with a sly smile ""smart of you not to answer my question directly! Not all sphinxes are as honorable as myself, and many would hide their mortal riddles in something that would otherwise appear as everyday pleasantries. And to answer your question, I'm called the *Asphirinx* in mocking by my peers."" She seemed hesitant to say more.

""Why is that?"" Pushed on the explorer hesitantly, and perhaps unwisely. There was something not entirely right going on, but he couldn't put his finger on it.

""Well, I take lots of aspirin to handle my pain. You see, on my very first night on the job an adventurer came to the entrance of the tomb where I was posted. We went through the usual process where I asked him an impossible riddle, and when he failed I ate him. However, the bastard managed to lodge his sword into my fangs and I haven't been able to get it out since"" 

As if to make sure there was no doubt she opened her jaws and the explorer could clearly see a broken piece of steel jammed at the back of the cavernous maw.

""Say. Would you be so kind as to take it out? If you do I promise to help you get past my cousin, the big and mighty Sphinx"".

The explorer stood there, pondering what to do. Thinking whether this was a riddle or not. Even if it wasn't, the wrong answer might be deadly.

""Don't worry, that's not a riddle. Tell you what, you don't have to answer. Just walk away if you want. My species is bound by ancient and sacred laws to not hurt seekers unless they guess incorrectly our puzzles"". 

She gave what amounted to a slight smile and then slowly opened her mouth.

The explorer didn't know what to do. Walking away might be seen as an offence, and even if he believed what she said about ancient laws he didn't know to what extent these would protect him.

Moreover, the explorer didn't know anything about dentistry. 

But overall, he thought his chances were better if he helped out the Asphirinx. He might be able to pull out the shard by sheer force, and knowledge that would bring him closer to enter the sacred city would prove invaluable in his quest.

""Ok, here I go"" he said, as he rolled up his sleeves and put on his thick hide gloves. 

Hesitantly he reached inside the Asphirinx's mouth and grabbed the jagged metal with both hands. Thank God for opposable thumbs. 

""Ready?"" he asked

The Asphirinx nodded and shut her eyes. The explorer took a deep breath and, hoping this was not a mistake, pulled hard.

""Oooouch!"" yelled the Asphirinx ""that hurt!"" But her eyes opened wide when she saw the broken sword tip in the explorer's hands. ""Is... Is that it? Did you get all of it out?"" 

The explorer nodded. ""yes, you only had this single piece jammed in there"".

The Asphirinx roared, flapping it's wings in joy and relief.  ""I've never said this to a mortal, but thank you. I've had that damned shard embedded in my mouth for over 2000 years now. For this I owe you a debt I intend to repay. Is it still your wish to know how to answer my cousin's riddle?""

""Yes, that is still my desire. I need to get into the sacred city"" said the explorer

The Asphirinx stopped to look at him, a mischievous smile took shape upon her face. 

""Tut-tut, I thought you had more sense and understood the basic concept of dealing with a Sphinx: never answer any question!"" she said, as she prowled towards the explorer ""You see, I am the one and only SPHINX and you've just answered my riddle incorrectly. However, I won't kill you. I grow tired of living under these dead stones, always guarding something, never able to leave. I have a much better idea""

As quick as that her paw flew towards the explorer who shut his eyes and put his hands up in a futile attempt to protect himself.

And yet, nothing happened.

Slowly he opened his eyes and had a moment of vertigo. He was up, looking down at himself. ""what the hell?"" he thought. And looking further down he saw huge paws where he expected to find his feet. His mouth dropped.

""You see, as the Sphinx I had special powers to enforce whatever punishment I deemed appropriate"" she said ""so I did us both a favor. You'll get to be the might Sphinx, able to roam through these dry corridors to your heart's content, while I get go out into the world and be someone once again"" she said with a triumphant smile ""It's the perfect arrangement""

Seeing her smile on his face was an uncanny experience. He tried to speak but all that came out was a broken growl. His whole body started to wobble while his mind adjusted to the altered position of his preexisting limbs, and the presence of a few new ones.

""It's not a bad life you know? Being an immortal magical creature definitely has its perks."" She said as she circled him ""There's even the odd explorer that will come to visit every now and then.""

The explorer, having regained some control over himself, fumbled for something to say ""What do you mean you'll get to be someone once again?""

She smiled knowingly ""oh no, you won't get me with the same trick"" he didn't know what she was talking about ""Remember, now you're the Sphinx, take care of your words"" she turned and started walking towards the darkened corridor, leaving the torch abandoned on the floor.

""Au revoir my dear explorer, or should l say mighty sphinx?"" she laughed as she turned to walk away and the musty corridors all around seemed to laugh with her. ""Enjoy your time exploring these old bones, and be mindful of sword-carrying fools"".

I'm sure many of you have been asked this very question when meeting someone for the first time. After all, it is a great inquiry that offers lots of followup opportunities, the bread and butter of small talk.

But is it actually the best question that we can ask? What does it tell about our society that our go-to question when we're getting to know someone is to ask them what *do they work on*. 

To be fair, it's not only the fault of the one doing the asking, but also of the one being asked; two sides of the same coin. If you think about it, most people are not comfortable with opening up to strangers. Imagine someone comes up to you and says *""hi, let's talk about our deepest fears and insecurities""*. I know I would feel uncomfortable, and would likely trip over myself in an attempt to impress whoever was asking me these questions. 

And that's why *""what do you do for a living""* works, it gives a chance for the other person to *flex*, and boast about themselves in an accepting context. 

I think **that** is probably a better indication of where the problem lies. What twisted logic makes us think that *work* is something we can use to feel good about ourselves, something we can use to impress. Almost as if it where the *most valuable* part of our lives, the forefront of our reputation towards society. Why isn't it acceptable for us to answer with other facets of our life? Is it because we feel people are not interested about the *tomatoes I grew in my garden this summer*, or the fact that *I have finally been able to talk myself into getting an appointment with a therapist*? I feel like these should be much more *valuable* human accomplishments than having a good position at a well known company. 

Also, why do push ourselves to impress the people we meet? Why do we have to treat *connecting with other humans* as a competition? I imagine there is some sort of [evolutionary tribal behavior](/hunting-a-mammoth/ ) somewhere in there. We put up walls all around ourselves, walls that are painted with bright colors and are filled with fancy signs and advertisements, but walls nonetheless. Why can't we just say *""hi, I'm happy for this connection, I'm grateful for the warmth of your human presence""*. Maybe that's a bit over the top but I think it's enough to get my point across. 

I think a better question to ask on meeting someone is *""what makes you happy""* or *""what do you enjoy doing""*. It's ambiguous enough so that if someone wants to answer with a superficial fact about themselves (like their work accolades) they can, but it also leaves enough space for that person to tell you *real stuff*.

My plan is to watch them in the same order in which they were released, so I started with [Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausica%C3%A4_of_the_Valley_of_the_Wind_(film))[^nausica-first]. 

While reading about the story for this film I found out that Hayao Miyazaki was having a hard time selling his movie ideas to studios, so he ended up creating a manga of this same story, which became so popular that his publisher asked him to create a movie. During this time his producer also enlisted the help of [Joe Hisaishi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Hisaishi ""Joe Hisaishi""), which would go on to become the composer for many of the future movie scores for Studio Ghibli!

The movie itself is wonderful. I don't know if maybe I'm biased in my appreciation but all of Miyazaki's movies have something that really sets them apart for me. While watching it I kept coming back to this idea, trying to pinpoint what it was that made it special. It's like there is a level of intimacy with the characters and story that is not common, but at the same time there is enough distance with them so that I can position myself firmly as a viewer. I don't know, maybe I just have this idea in my head and it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. Regardless, I had a good time with the movie and I heartily recommend it.

I wanted to comment on some points that I found interesting:

- Nausicaa and the *valley* where she's from are special, they're out of the ordinary in many dimensions. But most notably they're different because she and her people have a semblance of harmony with this new world. From the very beginning we're told how she's attuned *to the wind* (an expression of the natural energy).
- They also have *magic* (as in awe) and don't consider themselves above nature. All other civilizations we meet are all pretty similar, trying to get one up on each other, squabbling, and most importantly, trying their best to subjugate nature, to enforce their will on the world.
	- This contrast reinforces our perception, as viewers, of how good the protagonist is, and how bad everyone else is. We frequently see Nausicaa's attitude of acceptance and respect also extending to the *antagonist* figures, in turn gaining their respect as the story progresses.
	- This also highlights an important point in the story which is that of *balance*. Beings are defensive because there is a lot of aggression and ill-will going on, but if you remove the aggression then you'll find that everyone just wanted to be happy in the first place, and to avoid suffering. You'll find their defensiveness disappear.
		- Sure, it might be a romanticized version of nature, but I think it's one that speaks deeply to our yearning for communion with it. 
- The world itself plays a special role in that it is basically another character. It's mainly represented by the forest, and the insects with the mighty `Ohm` as their figurehead. As the movie progresses we learn that these don't want to *destroy* humans completely, and instead their desire is that of re-establishing a balance between all beings. A balance which the humans, in their avarice, have destroyed (as indicated by the toxic soil and water, and the purifying role the forest plays). 
	- I found it a pretty genial plot point that the *rebalancing effect* happened because these organisms co-evolved to be like this due to environmental pressures caused by humans. I can totally buy that.

---

Overall, I really enjoyed the movie. It speaks to our shared experience as beings that are oppressed, and sometimes oppress others. It also reinforces the connections that we have as part of nature, one that is often forgotten, underappreciated, in our over-industrialized world.

Another day, another journal entry. I've been telling myself I shouldn't use these as a low-effort dump yard, so now I'm hesitant about what to write. The real problem is that lately I tend to just enumerate the things that happened to me during the day. I think the key word here is *enumerate*, and has the connotation of *devoid of emotion* or importance.

So what is important? I shall embark myself on this journey, in *stream of consciousness* style! 

Important...

Important is taking about your friends, gushing out about the [Leica Q](https://craigmod.com/essays/leica_q/), going on at length about the last movie you saw, pouring out all your love and excitement about [Picotron](https://www.lexaloffle.com/picotron.php). Important is saying what you want to say, sharing and opening, exploring, shining the light in those dark places where you hardly dare visit, least the monster notices the open door and flees, locking you inside. Important is paying attention to where you walk, being mindful of every flower you trample on as you walk, knowing that it couldn't but have been otherwise. Important is being there. Really being there. That's all there is. 

What then should I write to feel like I'm really there? Well, that's silly! I'm already here. **This** is what I should write. But then the question becomes *what's the limit*, *where does it end*. 

It doesn't really. Especially not figurative prose. It's just an intermixing of stuff, on and on it goes. It never ends. That is, until you close the laptop's lid and tell yourself you're done for the day. Go to bed with the satisfaction of a job well done.

What am I getting at? Is there even a point here? No. There used to be one but there isn't anymore. Now it's just waves, the ebb and flow of the words giving more of a feeling than an actual sense.

An exploration in metric it is! In stringing a feeling through letters and hope the whole thing doesn't come tumbling down once you try and lift it up.

I'm sad about my dog, she's 6 years old, and three months ago started having infrequent seizures. The vet says she's probably got epilepsy and I'm not sure how to handle it or really what that means. He says we need to run more tests. But when? I feel like I'm just ignoring it sometimes. She seems happy though, and still runs in our backyard, up and down, up and down, as always.

Ah we're back. Back to what's important. Be here now. Be here now. Do I even need to write it down?

I've skipped meditation for the past two days. I've been feeling sick. But there's another reason, one I haven't really admitted myself, and that is that I feel like I haven't been doing a good job of it lately, not being able to relax as deeply, to focus wholly as I was before. Not sure why. But I know this is a toxic outlook to have on things, especially meditation. Setting goals changes the whole thing, the whole dynamic. In the mind, placebo is **everything**. There's nothing else really.

What we see, or better said, what we think we see is not really it. It's easy. Everyone can come to the conclusion with some reflection. We see only what our senses tell us. But ah! Where do we see the fantastical world coming from our sense perception? In our mind of course. We think we're seeing a world *out there*, but really it's *in here*. Always in here. Who knows what's really out there? Who knows what amazing things our senses are not picking up? Our instruments, which are just imitation of our senses, blind to blooming energetic discharges. Overlapping universes in a single room.

In such a maelstrom of madness, what is it that's really important then? What is it? Tell me!

In the absence of a clear point, of a safe harbor, of an anchor, stability must be constructed. And even if constructed it does not mean it's invaluable. Even if ultimately baseless it does not mean it cannot be a place where we can sit and rest and think. Be kind to yourself and to others, everything else is just fun and games, and everything that goes contrary to this just increases the energy of the storm.

Take a breath. Be here now. See you tomorrow.

Many things have changed since I became a parent (including not wanting to be a parent to begin with), but the one that has impacted me the most is *how fast things seem to be moving now*. I know it's a cliche, people saying that time speeds up after you become a parent, but it's true.

On one side this is not necessarily bad. I'm definitely much (much) busier now than I was before, I now have enough free time to just do maybe one or two *personal* things I want to on a given day. On the surface it sounds bleak, but I'm lucky in that I actually enjoy spending time with my son. Playing with him, seeing him learn and grow (and seeing me learn to be a parent), have been one of the biggest joys of my life.

Being extra busy has also been a positive for my mental health in some ways. The fact that I have less *free time* also means I have less time to spend worrying about senseless stuff (my favorite hobby), less time to spend ruminating or imagining painful futures that are extremely unlikely to happen.

However, there's always something special going on lately, always something noteworthy. This, coupled with the strict schedule that my days seem to have, makes it so that my days appear to be blurring one into the other.

I feel that before, when there wasn't much happening in my life, I could use special events as markers, obelisks or island that I could look back on to measure the passage of time. But how can you measure time if you have a wall, just stretching out backwards until the horizon? 

Earlier this week I was telling my son how well he was walking, and then realized that he's been walking ok for the past 6 months or so! I still feel like he started walking last month.

I imagine this blurring is greatly enhanced by the fact that, with a kid, things mostly happen in a continuous way. Every once in a while you do get new behaviors from one day to the next, but mostly things evolve slowly over a large span of time. For instance, my son has been babbling (what I think is mostly) nonsense for a while now, but how do you know when that nonsense stops being him just parroting words he hears, and starts being original thoughts? By the time you notice, you've already been hearing him express himself for a while without realizing what was happening.

Looking back I can see how this feeling, that things are just slipping through my mind, is a big inspiration for why I've been writing so much lately. Maybe I'm subconsciously trying to leave some kind of mark for my future self saying *I was here*, something I can look back on and see how things have changed.

You can't really put a kid on pause and then come back to them when you feel like it. They have their own peculiar way to *summon* attention, and I think we (as parents) are biologically wired to provide it. And this is good. I often find myself reevaluating my behaviors, admonishing myself when I do something I wouldn't like him to repeat, and in so doing I've realized I'm steadily, slowly, reinventing small parts of myself as I try to be the best role model I can be. 

Sure, I don't always manage it, and sometimes it can't be helped, but it's definitely the best motivator I've had to try and grow as a person. 

Reminds me of the popular cheesy quote that goes something like:

> Try to be the person you want your children to grow into.

A nice idea he brought up is that a short story can be seen as *""the ending to a book you never wrote""*, or the beginning, or a snippet of something that happens somewhere in the middle. You go up to it, you experience it, and then you go on your way without needing to elaborate further. 

This clicked with me because I've always considered myself a collector of what I call *""vignettes""*. These are short scenes that I've always thought of as belonging to a larger story. I sometimes write them down somewhere and tell myself I'll leave them there until I have a story where they might fit in, but I don't ever really do anything with them.

I realized that all along I've the seeds for many potential short stories and I was letting them go stale! No need to feel bad about it though, as the inspiration behind most (all) of the ones I have kept has long been lost, and I didn't write them down in enough detail to be able to recreate what was it that excited me about that particular scene.

But still, it's a good thing. I'll keep an eye out for any new *vignettes* of this kind and see what comes up if I just let them free on the page! 

Going back to the episode...

Neil Gaiman also answered a question I've always had about short stories: how long should they actually be. 

It turns out that they can be anything from 10 words to 8k words. He gave a fantastic example of a short story he did in only 100 words called [Nicholas Was...](https://www.neilgaiman.com/works/Books/Smoke+%2526+Mirrors/in/197/). I can't include it here because of copyright, but I strongly encourage you to read it by clicking the previous link.

His short story is good, and chilly, and I think it exemplifies really well his description of what a short story actually is:

I was worried that if I allowed myself to follow lots of people then I would eventually end up swamped by posts I wouldn't have time to read nor the heart to skip. Brandon [recently answered](https://brandonwrites.xyz/re-on-following-many-blogs/) my own post with a good point and inspired me to allow myself to explore more. 

I spent a couple of days just digging through the blogosphere, and as always was amazed by the diversity I found. I also realized some important things: 

- What I write is strongly influenced by what I read. Not only in content but also in style.
- There's no real guideline in how to create posts. There's no expectations you need to fulfill, no boxes you need to check. There's nothing you need to do besides doing whatever you want. 
- I tend to solidify the way I write. In other words, I tend to think there is a correct and incorrect way for me to write posts. This is a direct contradiction of the point above, and is ultimately a harmful illusion because it keeps me from exploring different styles and topics!

I think all of these (except for point 1, which is just my personality) stem from the fact that I'm currently reading too few things, most of which share a certain common topology. There are other people out there, writing wonderful things in exciting new ways, and I just don't know about them.

Up until now I've been reading almost exclusively people that have their blog on Bearblog. They're all awesome and interesting in their own right, but if we think about it in terms of statistics then we could say my *distribution* is strongly skewed towards the sort of people that have a Bearblog in the first place.

I think a good place to find new people to follow is by checking out the *blogrolls* of the people I currently like, and pick some from there. Sure, it's not a perfectly random sample but I think it should be good enough to start with.

...

I feel bad saying the word *follow*. It almost sounds like I'm building some sort of number-objective-social-media-crap. It also has the implication of *going behind*, *trailing behind*, which I've always found unsatisfactory. I think a better term would be to *keep up* with someone you *respect*. But I can't think of a way to say this that sounds good.

After all, that's what you do when you've been reading someone's posts for a while. You get to know them, and you respect them as individuals. I keep coming back to the blogs I *like to keep up with* because I've found I appreciate and respect the authors, and like to know their opinions on stuff. 

Even if sometimes I don't agree with said opinions I always find them useful because they help me find out what my own opinions are, or introduce me to new ideas or ways of looking at things that I hadn't considered before.

...

Since I started this blog I've spent a considerable amount of time thinking about how *to be more authentic*. I've usually held to the idea that the least blogs I read, the easier it would be since I'll have less external influence. But now I realize this is wrong.

At the beginning it was kind of messy, with my notes not really having any structure, but then I discovered *interstitial journaling*, which basically guides you to write *timed notes*. Every day I open up a new file and by the end it looks somewhat like this:

```text
10:00 — Spoke to Sam about the ring. We decided he can't help me take it
13:00 — I heard Gollum talking to himself again. I wonder, will this happen to me as well?
15:00 — I was thirsty and asked Sam for some water. I think I dribbled some of it.
```

[^logseq-upsell]: If you're interested, to make my notes and keep them tidy I use a free, open-source software called [Logseq](https://logseq.com/). It automatically creates a daily note for me every day, and makes linking notes very easy! It supports a lot of advanced usages but for me the basic features are good enough. The only extra thing I use is [a community plugin](https://github.com/QWxleA/logseq-interstitial-heading-plugin) to easily support interstitial journaling, which basically just adds a hotkey to add the current time where my cursor is.

My own notes are usually longer than these, with a single note frequently spanning multiple paragraphs of *facts* and sometimes even *reflections*. But I think this example should be enough to understand the point.

Work journaling is really useful by both providing you a way to keep grounded on what you're doing and giving you a log of occurrences you can refer back to in the future. Not to mention it's a great way to practice writing!

But I'm not here to convince you to start journaling during your workday, or to talk about the details of how I do it. What I actually want to talk about is how different it is to journal in this way vs writing here. Or at least how different *I* want it to be.

When writing on this blog I could talk to you about random stuff that happened today, or misc facts, or (worse still) try to build a *brand*[^build-a-brand]. But that's not what I want. The reason I started this blog is to practice writing, yes, but not the kind of banal writing I do every day in my work notes.

[^build-a-brand]: This is very much something I don't want to do. It's an always present trap though. One I've fallen for in the past, so I need to be wary of it. 

What I really want to do is tear my heart out, impale it on the page, and send it to the void of the internet where (maybe) someone will see it. Raw. Bloody. Pumping. I want my pen to be thunder, and my words to be lightning. 

I'm usually not good at talking, or even admitting, about how I feel. But I know I have a heart, I hear it in the quiet and stillness of the night. Once I rise from bed though it seems we lose each other. I want to (learn how to) be authentic to myself. 

My goal with this blog is not that of writing a set of entertaining posts, or simply learn to wield *the written word*. It's to strengthen this connection with my heart, with my subconscious. Of course, having entertaining posts is a nice plus! 

As someone that comes from traditional social medias I feel there's so little of this in my life. I'm surrounded by pictures and funny posts, people offering me an external view of their lives. And while I do appreciate keeping up with long-lost friends, I yearn for more. What about their inner lives? Are they ok? Am I different for having feelings, doubts, fears? What do they want? What are they trying to accomplish? 

But it's not only them that are at fault here. I've never expressed these things myself either. It would be easy to fault our society or whatnot, but the truth is that I avoid it. I don't talk about these things with anyone. I'm afraid to be *someone*, while at the same time I yearn to know who I am.

With this post I vow not to write about anything that doesn't make me *feel*. If I do sound bland, or if you feel I'm just feeding you facts without any *uph* to it then please let me know.

I know I'm setting lofty goals. Perhaps with time, and practice, I might be able to achieve them. At the same time I don't want to set any standard for myself. That would be bad; trying to fulfill a script. I'm sure I'll write a lot of _banal_ stuff on the way. 

It's mostly a solitary undertaking, but I would be happy if you accompany me on the way.

He mentioned some quotes I really liked which I'll paraphrase here:

- *Your voice is the things you do wrong*
	- He said this is actually a quote from Jerry Garcia (the guitarist from Grateful Dead)
	- If you did everything 100% correctly then you would sound exactly the same as everyone else. This was in the context that one shouldn't stress about *finding your voice* because *your voice is what will happen anyways once you stop trying*.
- *There are a million bad drawings in your pencil. As an artist your job is to get them out so you can get to the new ones.*
	- This was a quote by Chuck Jones, one of the main illustrators behind the Looney Tunes.
	- This was in the context about the importance of *just doing it*, which is a requirement to actually improve — just thinking about doing something won't really make you any better.

While watching this episode I started wondering why I was actually seeing it. Why am I even going through the effort of watching this masterclass. 

Ever since I was little I've thought that writers had the coolest job in the world — perhaps after Himalayan yogis who got to sit around all day pondering the mysteries of reality. And while I have written some stories I'm not near as feverish at it as other people.

For example, in this episode Niel Gaiman said that he had *""crates""* (his word) of unfinished stories by the time he was 17 (this was a comment about not feeling bad for not finishing stuff, although there is more to learn if one sees them to completion). I have started (as in *wrote down something*) maybe 20 or 30 stories total, with 3 or so finished. 

Pondering this made me realize that even though I've had this *yearning to create stories* ever since I can remember I haven't really done anything about it. I don't think I want to transition careers (I'm very lucky in that I really enjoy my job), but I do want to set a goal and hopefully do something in this direction. I want to learn to create experiences that, as Tolkien puts it, *hold the attention of readers, amuse them, delight them, and at times maybe excite them or deeply move them*. 

I want to create (small) things I can share, hopefully while also sharing some of the emotions that move me. Be able to build bridges and connect with others, be able to make sense of the world through narratives.

Earlier today I was browsing around Bearblog and stumbled upon Elisa's blog [Floating Flinders](https://flinders.bearblog.dev/). All her posts are great and I love the clarity of self reflection and honesty in her writing. But there is one post in particular that resonates with what I'm writing here, her post about [15 minute stories](https://flinders.bearblog.dev/15-minute-stories/). She writes short stories inspired by her dreams but the goal is just to write something and not think much about it. Sort of like [wordvomits](https://meadow.bearblog.dev/blog/?q=wordvomit) I guess, just start with an idea and let yourself run with it for a short while.

I've been going through some of the ones she's posted and I really like them. I like the format, and the freedom / flexibility it brings. So I want to set that as my writing goal: get in the habit of making 15 minute stories of my own!

I think this is a nice amount. I imagine in the future I might *subscribe* to a couple of new ones but not that many (maybe 5?, less than 10), which raises the question of *""how many is too many?""* and more importantly *""what to do when I've reached the 'too many' point?""*. 

I can't think of any of the blogs I follow that I would like to replace with another. After spending some time reading someone's random thoughts you kind of start to appreciate that person! On one hand I'm interested in knowing what's going on in their life, and on the other I feel like I'm somehow supporting them by reading what they write, cheering for them from my own shadowy corner. It's like being friends, but information flows in a single direction. I feel that I would lose this feeling of *closeness* if I start following many people at once. If allowed to go to the extreme I would probably find myself with a maddening cacophony of noise which would make me stop reading them OR stop appreciating each individual *individually*. I dread the idea of finding myself with a *wordier Twitter*.

I've read that [some people](https://tracydurnell.com/2023/11/30/building-community-out-of-strangers/) do follow hundreds of different blogs without any issues, and have the presence of mind to link to many of those posts in their own writing (which gives me the impression that they pay close attention to them). I'm sure these people enjoy following many blogs and publishing answers to other's posts, but I don't think I would like to make my blog mainly about *conversing* with others. Connecting is wonderful, but I want to leave space for personal exploration. Though maybe I'm just saying this because I tend to lean towards the introverted side of things.

Anyway, there's no real conclusion to any of this. I think the best thing to do here (as in many other areas of life) is to just let the thing flow naturally, and see what happens. I might even surprise myself ending up following lots of different people and not suffering about it!",,,,,,2024-02-15T02:15:07.457110+00:00,22,0,108.9413871790943,False,False

The book tells the story of how the *Hogfather* — the Santa Claus figure of the Discworld — is destroyed and then saved. The story's theme, I feel, centers around the issue of the human conception of the universe and how we make sense of it. 

The passage I'm talking about is a dialogue that happens around the end of the book between *Death* and Susan — the protagonist, who is also *Death*'s granddaughter — discussing what would've happened if Susan hadn't been able to save the Hogfather.

It gives me the chills every time I read it, even after all this time. It does such a good job at capturing the core of the human experience. As humans we don't ever really see the world directly, we see the stories we tell ourselves about it, and we can end up telling ourselves all sort of negative stories about how things work.

This extra layer that we put on top of reality is sort of like a *lens* that tinges everything we see. This lens' color and shape is dictated by the stories we tell ourselves and the combination of these is unique to each one of us. 

However, this same capability is also what enables us to be human: to create, express ourselves through art, connect with other *humans*, to imagine a better tomorrow. This is perfectly captured in this next passage, which follows shortly after the one above.

> STARS EXPLODE, WORLDS COLLIDE, THERE’S HARDLY ANYWHERE IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE HUMANS CAN LIVE WITHOUT BEING FROZEN OR FRIED, AND YET YOU BELIEVE THAT A…A BED IS A NORMAL THING. IT IS THE MOST AMAZING TALENT. 
> 
> “Talent?” 
> 
> OH, YES. A VERY SPECIAL KIND OF STUPIDITY. YOU THINK THE WHOLE UNIVERSE IS INSIDE YOUR HEADS. 
> 
> “You make us sound mad,” said Susan. 
> 
> NO. YOU NEED TO BELIEVE IN THINGS THAT AREN’T TRUE. HOW ELSE CAN THEY BECOME?

(Terry Pratchett was truly a genius / philosopher / poet able to express the deepest truths about the human experience in such simple words that they just seem obvious.)

I love how *Death*, with his omnipresent point of view, has knowledge of the whole cosmos and is baffled by what humans consider normal (in this case, a *bed*). But in reality these things are all but normal. This specific part always makes me chuckle, and also appreciate how many things we take for granted that are actually truly miraculous.

As humans WE NEED these stories to make sense of the world, a human mind just couldn't work without them. I see it in my own mind: all these preconceptions, ideas, behaviors I force myself to align with (even if I don't like them), all the things I consider to be *me*. 

These stories are also what allow us to perceive magic (*good* or *bad*) in the world. Its roots borrow deep into them, and grows forward, bearing fruit into our reality. This is what makes a sunset beautiful, or gives us the sense of *awe* at seeing a perfect snowflake falling during a windless winter day. A *being* incapable of perceiving it would just see a *""MERE BALL OF FLAMING GAS""*.

The final idea is that creativity is equal parts imagination and hope: imagination allows us to *imagine* (duh) an alternative, but it is hope that gives it energy and movement, the drive to find said alternative. *Hope* that an alternative is even possible to begin with.

I might be getting a bit off track but I can't resist sharing another great quote (also by Terry Pratchett, this time from [Witches Abroad](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/929672-witches-abroad)). I won't comment on it directly but I think it is relevant enough to be included.

> People think that stories are shaped by people. In fact, it's the other way around.  
> 
> Stories exist independently of their players. If you know that, the knowledge is power. 
> 
> Stories, great flapping ribbons of shaped space-time, have been blowing and uncoiling around the universe since the beginning of time. And they have evolved. The weakest have died and the strongest have survived and they have grown fat on the retelling.

Stories **are** a powerful thing. Be mindful of the stories you consume (and more importantly **how** you consume them), and what you tell yourself. I think we frequently underestimate the effect they can have in our lives.

While writing this post I'm realizing that I could incorporate some of these things into my own life. 

- Everything — especially the *negative* things — I believe about myself are **stories** I accept as true and identify with. But they **are not** truths set in stone.
- The flip side of the point above: If I can imagine a better version of myself then I can make it a reality with dedication. It's often I perceive things within myself that I would like to be otherwise, and always end up accepting them as *facts*.

When I was first starting to make cold brew at home I had trouble finding a proper recipe to do it. Pretty much all websites that Google suggested were crappy marketing sites where the recipe was buried in a quagmire of useless content and ads. And those recipes I did find where always of the form ""*making cold brew is easy, just add your favorite coffee and water, leave for a day and then strain*"", which is something any person can infer and doesn't really tell you anything.

I eventually stumbled on some Reddit comments[^reddit-source] explaining the process, and after doing some experimentation I think I have a good process going. I wanted to share it here to help other people like me, who wanted to do it but are not sure how. Trust me, it's really easy.

# What you'll need

- A big-ish container. Anything works.
- Something to strain your coffee. I use a normal coffee strainer, but also a French press would work.
- Coffee. In my experience it doesn't matter much if you use a coarse or fine grind, or an expensive or cheap coffee. Personally I use a cheap medium roast fine grind, mainly because it's easily available. You'll need at least 2 cups of coffee.
- Measuring cups are great to have if you care about correctness.

# Brewing

**Ratio:** 1:8 ratio by weight. According to my measurement that's 1 cup of ground coffee for every 3.5 cups of water.

Fill your container with as many repetitions of the *ratio* as you want (or as many as fit in your container). Then leave in the fridge for 24h. Some people leave it outside at room temperature, and some leave it for 12h, but I like fridge+24h because the end result tends to be less bitter.

# Serving

**tl;dr** - For each serving: 7 tablespoons (a bit less then half a cup) of concentrate + 1 (or 1.5) cup of water

This part is something that *""guides""* never mention. The most I've found are some vague instructions like `serve 1:1 or 1:2 ratio of concentrate and water`. This sounds good enough I guess, but for someone who is sensitive to caffeine as I am it's better to know how much caffeine is in your cup, unless I want to be miserable for the next 8 hours or so as the coffee courses through my body.

Let's do some quick math. When preparing coffee in a French press I use 2 tablespoons of coffee, any more than that and I get the jitters, so I'll be aiming at getting the same amount from cold brew (you can adapt as needed). If we brew two *ratio*s then we'll use 2 cups of coffee and 7 cups of water while extracting. So there would be 16 tablespoons of coffee per cup in the concentrate, meaning that there are a total of 32 tablespoons.

To make things easier, the 7 cups can be equated to 112 tablespoons. Assuming dissolution of caffeine is uniform (and I think we CAN assume it because caffeine is easily soluble in water), there are `32/112=0.285` tablespoon-worth's of caffeine per tablespoon in the concentrate.

That means that when I serve my cup, if I want 2 tablespoon-worth's of caffeine then I need to serve `0.285*x=2` which is ~7 tablespoons of concentrate (a bit less than half-a-cup). 

So that's it for the amount of *concentrate* to serve, but what about the amount of water? Well, that really depends on your taste. I personally like a bigger cup even if the flavor is more diluted so I'll add 1.5 cups of water.

--- 

Somewhere along the way, in the century of the self, we forgot each other. We forgot this vast and wonder-filled universe, of which we are each but a tiny and transient wonder.

We forgot that all creative work — be it music or mathematics, poetry or physics, anything we might call art — is a hand outstretched in the dark, reaching not for visibility but for the light that lives between us. Reaching for connection.

We forgot what Whitman knew even as he proclaimed “I celebrate myself!” — that “every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.” No word appears in *Leaves of Grass* more times than *you*.

We are living through a pandemic of selfing — rampant self-celebration that mistakes applause for connection, likes for love. Social media companies are capitalizing on our native need for affirmation, exploiting our compromised immunity to manipulation at every turn: algorithms prioritizing selfies over sunflowers, algorithms amplifying the word _I_, algorithms doping us on the dopamine of being noticed, seducing us into forgetting the art and joy of noticing — that crowning glory of consciousness. And somewhere, in the quiet core of our being, this frantic hunt for likes is making us like ourselves less.

There must be another way — a way to [unself](https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/10/21/iris-murdoch-unselfing/) just enough to remember each other, to grow a little more awake to this world that shimmers with wonder, of which any one self is only a fleck.

Whatever that way is, it is not some new technology. Maybe it is a new ethic. Maybe it is the oldest ethic.

Around once a month Gio's wife sent him over to the supermarket to buy stuff, which was all fine and good; at least the part that you could do by yourself... At least the part you did not need to speak to anyone.

Many years back, the government created a way to recognize *asocial* members of society. In an uncharacteristic moment of cleverness they came up with a very simple, yet effective solution: the deli counter in supermarkets. 

Today was Gio's first time in over 20 years buying cheese and cold-cuts all by himself. Society was brutal in purging asocial members and, while he didn't think he was one, his doubts scared him so he had done his best to avoid going alone. But today it couldn't be helped.

He got there and was faced by the usual friendly, aged clerk. He puts up a convincing front but everyone knows he is really an undercover government official.

“What can I help you with, Sir?” he said.

Gio noticed the judge looking at him. There’s always at least one judge. Always. They have the appearance of old, harmless ladies, but do not be fooled! They are extremely good observers, and are trained to expertly judge the actions of others.

“Sir?” said the clerk.

“Yes, I would like some Iberico ham please.”

He had studied this part. There are many different kinds of ham and not knowing that is a one-way ticket to DOOM.

“Sure, how much do you want?”

Damn, he had not prepared well enough for this.

“Err, give me, … 120 grams” said Gio.

He could feel his hands starting to sweat, and the penetrating gaze of the judge aimed directly at him. He stumbled, and they all knew it. He must tread carefully now.

“And how thin do you want me to slice it?” said the clerk in a clipped voice as he turned on the meat slicer. He was no longer smiling.

This was just too much for Gio. 

“I.. I… Could you... Could you cut it, *thin*?” he said with a not-so-hopeful grin.

Silence. That’s all they answered. Both the judge and the clerk were glaring at him. They were somewhat surprised; both of them had been in service for over 20 years and neither had ever encountered an actual asocial.

The judge spoke “You have been individuated, asocial, there’s no room for you in our society. You are sentenced to DOOM!”, the lady pulled on her cane, a trapdoor open below Gio and he fell.

DOOM was known as a concept to everyone, but Gio soon discovered it was a steel chute about 20 meters deep, with a lava pit at the bottom. 

As he was falling, a single thought went through his mind

“This is absurd.”

He then plunged into the lava and the world was rid of an undesirable asocial.

When *singing* was involved I would usually remain silent, worrying that I would sound off key, or that I wouldn't know the words and people would notice, or any other myriad of possible scenarios which are common to those who worry endlessly about stuff. In some way, I perceived the act of *singing* as something very *intimate* and I never managed to break through that barrier I had imposed upon myself. That is, until I had a son, but it wasn't that easy.

After he was born, my wife used to sing to him all the time. She has beautiful voice, knows lots of songs, and is so confident in her ability that she doesn't really think about it. I, however, shied away from the act, as if a panel of judges would condemn me for my sub-par singing and banish me into the eternal void.

My wife used to get (a little bit) angry at me about this, telling me I should take the opportunity to sing to him *now* since before I knew it he would grow up and I would regret not having done it. And yet, I couldn't bring myself to do it, or at least not immediately. I, of course, knew of my problem and I wanted to be able to share singing time with him, especially because he seemed to enjoy it so much when my wife (or others) sang to him. So I started small, with what I knew I could comfortably do.

I've always been a *musical* person. I don't (didn't) sing, but I've always been good at playing instruments and picking up songs by ear. So I picked up a small [Kalimba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbira) I had lying around, which my wife had gifted me for a past Christmas, and I set out to learn the tunes of some lullabies. I started with *Twinkle Twinkle Little Star*, and then moved on to some other ones, my wife would sing and I would accompany her with the tune. 

Then I took another step. I ditched the crutch of the *kalimba* and starting humming the songs while we were getting ready for bed. Now that I think about it, this happened pretty much by itself once I got comfortable with the whole routine. I didn't think much about it at the time. 

As he grew up more he started playing at singing songs, coming up with random words that followed the same melody. To my own surprise, I found myself inescapably drawn to his game, and before I knew it I was singing at the top of my lungs with him, coming up with silly songs, making him laugh, and in general having a good time. I think at this time my *crutch* was that specific melody, one I knew very well by this point and was comfortable *riffing on*. 

Fast forward some months and now I don't feel any hesitation singing to my son, be it in public or in private. Actually, it's one of our favorite games, and we're even starting to introduce new melodies, new words, and even dancing (another thing which I've always considered myself incapable of doing)!

Why am I writing all of this you might ask? Well, this is a reflection on the fact that all *creative* endeavors, all activities that require you to *make* something, will call for you to put a piece of yourself out there for all to see, and that can be uncomfortable. The trick, when you feel self-conscious about starting, is to start small.

You often hear people say *""take baby steps""*, but seldom we take this advise. Instead we think that starting *small* is not a good way to improve, so we bite out too much and invariably end up dropping whatever it is we're doing. In the process end up demotivated and thinking we're just incapable of doing it. Instead, it's better to start doing small things which are slightly uncomfortable, but that you trust you can do, and over time you'll see your own confidence, and capabilities grow.

I imagine it a bit like starting to wear glasses. If you've ever gone from *no-glasses* to *glasses* (and you're not one of those rare people great self-esteem) then you know how the first few days (or weeks) can be a little uncomfortable, being self-conscious. But then you get used to it, you just *stop* thinking about it. It's a little bit like that.

Ever since I was old enough to be allowed outside without supervision I've taken to walking everywhere I could. 

First it was around my neighborhood, getting to know every road, every alley, every nook. Walking by the places I had seen most of my life growing up allowed me to get to know them in a different light, teasing out their secrets with repetition and time. When one is young and without many responsibilities, as I was lucky to be, one can take the time to study things, *take the world in* as they say.

I eventually convinced some of my friends that lived close by to join me in my newfound hobby. We would take long, winding walks without any real purpose in mind besides that of spending time together, giving us a space to talk about big and small things, away from our parents and other distractions. It offered a kind of purity that I've found hard to recreate in later life. 

Growing up walking remained my main means of transportation. Even when I could take the bus or borrow my parents car I would often opt not to, unless my destination was too far, or the weather to inclement. 

I remember in my teens things changed and we started to walk towards an objective. Be it walking to the movie theater, to get something to eat, or buy cheap beers and cigarettes from a place around 30 minutes away, whose owner turned a blind eye to the fact that we were *obviously* underage. They were great times, everything under the sun was fresh and full of excitement, the felling that the world was our mollusk[^mollusc]. At the time I didn't notice it but walking towards a goal affected the *purity* of the activity. It was no longer something we did for the hell of it (as another blogger on Bear [recently put it](https://blog.whiona.me/what-happened-to-blogging-for-the-hell-of-it/)), but more a means to an end. A means we were all comfortable with.

Later in life I went to study abroad and I had the luck to live close enough to my university campus[^university-campus] to be able to walk to and from classes. My walks had become solitary once again, and while lonely at times in some way it also allowed me to rediscover the joy of paying attention to the beauty around me. 

By this time I had recently discovered audio books, and walking while listening to a good book quickly became one of my favorite activities. Audio books motivated me to again start walking for *the hell of it*. I would put on a good book and just walk. It was sort of a virtuous feedback loop where I walked because I wanted to listen to the book and I wanted to listen so I could go walking. 

Now it's been many years since I came back to live to my original country. I moved to the countryside and have lots of nice walking paths I can go on nearby. However, I do find myself missing walking with other people. I no longer have any close friends, and those from my youth are no longer interested in walking *for the hell of it*. Most are busy pursuing their careers or other vain goals. I don't fault them, in many ways this has happened to me as well. I no longer *walk* as much as I would like. I guess this is what our culture would call growing up. 

It's not all bad though, and I see hope on the horizon. I have a beautiful family and a 2 year old son from whom I'm constantly learning how to recognize what are the real things in life, the important things, and that *awe* is the natural state of our minds[^awe-minds].

I'm ironically reminded of Johnnie Walker's motto *""Keep Walking""*[^keep-walking]. I don't think the company meant it like this, but it is a good rule to follow, keep doing things that you like because you like them and not to derive anything from them. Reevaluate your priorities if necessary, remember to always keep track of what the important things are. Small moments of hapiness go a long way. 


[^mollusc]: Borrowed from the great Terry Pratchett. If I remember correctly he uses this wording in multiple places throughout his books. It's one of my favorites, it clearly highlights how common things can change if you shine a different light at them. This is something he was a master of. 

[^university-campus]: I had the luck to study in a small city in the Italian alps called Trento, which is a beautiful beautiful city. If you have the chance you should go. 

[^awe-minds]: As we grow older this is something that's so easy to forget, we start pursuing things that are really void of any value if you measure value by how much happiness and fulfillment you have. 

[^keep-walking]: Which, according to their website, stands for *""It embodies our desire for progress, the fuel to tackle adversity, and joy of unfiltered optimism.""*. It sounds like marketing fluff. ",,,,,,2023-10-22T15:21:58.693645+00:00,7,0,100.19737870605674,False,False
54964,24977,VoyrTCqGpCCnHEgBBBdo,The flower doesn’t go from bud to blossom in one spritely burst,the-flower-doesnt-go-from-bud-to-blossom-in-one-spritely-burst,,2023-10-31T15:21:34.374985+00:00,2024-01-30T16:25:16.861884+00:00,[],True,True,False,"As much as I would like to take credit for the title of this post, I can't. It's a phrase from the front page of [The Marginalian](https://www.themarginalian.org/). The quote itself is:

> “Expect anything worthwhile to take a long time.” This is borrowed from the wise and wonderful Debbie Millman, for it’s hard to better capture something so fundamental yet so impatiently overlooked in our culture of immediacy. The myth of the overnight success is just that — a myth — as well as a reminder that our present definition of success needs serious retuning. The flower doesn’t go from bud to blossom in one spritely burst and yet, as a culture, we’re disinterested in the tedium of the blossoming. But that’s where all the real magic unfolds in the making of one’s character and destiny.

I find this to be really *on-point*. While the quote itself applies mainly to the process of *becoming* something/someone I think this actually permeates the whole sphere of our mental experience.

Everything in our lives tends to immediacy. You want *ice* to cool down your drink? You got it. You want hot water to bathe? You got it. You want to feel better by looking at cat videos? You got it. I imagine this is an effect of how businesses evolve: the one that satisfies a need with the least amount of hassle is the one that wins. Nature (and by extension also our minds) prefer the path of least resistance.

But what does this do to our psyche? In bygone ages if we wanted to be entertained we had to *make some effort* to get it. For example, compare a game of tag versus watching Instagram on your phone. One will give you an easy *dopamine hit* without much effort on your side, while the other requires you to put in the work to actually play a game. Are we, without realizing it, teaching ourselves that happiness is to be found in low-hanging fruits, and that (taken to the extreme) is better to avoid having to work for it? 

I remember when I was a kid I would spend hours outside, looking at plants, insects, and was constantly amazed by the awesomeness that is our earth. Now that I'm older though my entertainment mainly revolves around reading books, watching videos, and video-games. I find that when I try to enjoy something that takes a bit more effort on my part (e.g. playing chess) I feel easily frustrated and there is this thought in the back of my mind ""*why does it have to be so hard?*"".

It's complicate though. Even if you decide to drop all your ""easy entertainment"" then you'll still have to deal with the other people in your life that continue consuming it. A very poignant example that comes to mind, and I imagine most of us have experienced at some point, is being with a group of friends at a table and suddenly realizing that everyone is on their phone. We don't do this out of malice of course, and it's also not because we think our friends are boring. We do it because our mind wants to be entertained, we want that dopamine stream to keep flowing. It takes less effort to take out our phones than to participate and maintain an engaging conversation. Again, nature favors the path of least resistance.

The act in itself is not *evil* and I don't think anyone should feel bad if they want to look at their phone instead of doing other stuff. Sometimes it's an easy way to wind down. But we should be mindful not to overdo it. If we do, then we're solidifying those mental pathways, we're getting ourselves used to living in a *stream of dopamine*. And guess what - once that stream is interrupted for any reason we'll feel sad, unsatisfied, or even mad with the reason for the interruption.

Of course cellphones, Instagram, etc, are the extreme case. We can compare them with watching TV, which is also an *easy* way to entertain ourselves. By definition TV requires *0-effort* on your part (besides remaining awake). But I think there is an important difference when compared to cellphones, and that is that TV is not usually easily accessible, it's usually a compartmentalized activity to which you dedicate a specific amount of time and happens in a specific location. You don't frequently see someone whip up their iPad while waiting in line at the grocery store and start watching their favorite series. But it's almost everyone that takes out their phone. The reason? Well I think it's because TV requires much more time than watching a reel, and as such it is not a convenient *quick fix*. Again, we also shouldn't overdo TV, because if not we would find ourselves at square one.

I recently wrote a [blog post](/on-the-need-to-feel-productive/) about how I feel *bad* whenever I'm not doing something. Reflecting on it a bit more, I think this negative feeling is not just related to feeling *bad* for not being producing, but it's also feeling *dirty* because I'm not feeling *happy* (which is a circular argument if I've ever heard one). It's like I have this pressure on me saying that if I'm not constantly feeling *good* (ie, in the *dopamine stream*) then there's something wrong.

So is there any solution? I don't know. I'm also inside this hole, but I'm trying to get out of it. But I do have two suggestions that have worked for me. 

First, be mindful of whenever you get the *urge* to take out your phone. The important part is to notice it and make a conscious decision of whether that's what you want or now, don't let it be your default. 

Second, make art! Creating stuff is pretty much the opposite of *easy entertainment*, it requires effort and it's an excellent tool to get to know yourself. *Writing* is an example, but any *creative endeavor* fits the bill, after all, all art requires care and dedication and lays bare you heart for all to see.

At night I often think about sitting down to write something but feel like I don't have *anything that's worth putting down* so I just don't write. 

But in the few days that I've been doing doing [morning pages](/morning-pages/) I've noticed that good things will come out no matter what. It's like my subconscious is subverting myself — playing hide and seek: I think the well is dry but when I turn around and stop worrying it comes up with all sorts of interesting things, real things.

Not everything is good though, there still a lot of superfluous fluff. I feel part of the process is to peel out the cruft that is what you're **forcing** yourself to do, so that the actual *good stuff* can come out. This reminds me of a quote I like very much (from Ray Bradbury I think)

> It doesn't matter how much you want to nor how hard you try, you can't force a flower to bloom. You will only kill it in the process.

Same with creating, you can't force yourself. Instead trust in the process and good things will come when you stop trying.

I find myself to be so angry at the world, or sometimes it's worse and instead of anger there's just sadness. 

I know there are certain situations that I can more or less confidently say are sort of triggers for these feelings. For example, I live with my in-laws and during the holidays all their *offspring* come over and stay multiple days with us. Now, I do love them and I have no real problem with them, but there are situations when there's just a lot of mess, loud noises, and general insanity (espacially since some of them have small kids). After the first few days I feel like a length of rope, wound tighter and tighter, beginning to fray, losing its shape.

I imagine that in this specific instance the problem is that I don't want to change my otherwise peaceful life. I think there's some sort of control obsession going on, where I want something to be some way and then to realize I'm powerless to change it because, even though I think of my in-laws' house also as *my* house, it is still theirs and I have no real say in anything, I'm just one more of the bunch. 

Having these feelings makes me feel *incorrect*. They're my family after all. Shouldn't I, like, enjoy being with them ALL the time? Look forward to their *incursions* into my day to day existence? 

No. It doesn't sound right to feel bad about *having feelings*, but I do think I should be more mindful and realize that sometimes there's nothing to control, and that resenting them for their desire to be happy is not fair. 

Also, these frustration I have towards them usually makes me keep my distance, which in turn makes me feel more alienated from everyone, a stranger in my own home. 

I don't want this for myself. Luckily there is a clear path ahead, I only hope I have the determination and discipline to follow it: give up control.

This is some sort of continuation to my [Introduction](/introduction/) post. 

___

So, cool, now I have a blog, but what am I going to do with it?

I have been thinking about what to write for my first post and decided that to get it out of the way I would create a _meta-post_ of sorts. Like a stream-of-consciousness thing, thinking of setting a direction for the blog.

As I mentioned in the introduction post, I've made some attempts at writing a blog in the past. They inevitably fail because I stop writing on them; I lose my movitivation and the thought of spending time writing stuff becomes a burden rather than something I do for enjoyment, something I look forward to. Why is that?

I think the answer is that I end up forcing myself to write _useful_ stuff **all** the time, so eventually it gets to the point where I don't feel that what I'm writing is good enough, and the [impostor syndrome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) kicks in. 

I don't want this to happen to this blog. I want to be able to _write as the birds fly, as fish swim_[^as-birds-fly], without a thought to what I'm doing, organic and free flowing.

[^as-birds-fly]: I take this from a quote about Go Seigen, a master player of the game of Go. The actual quote goes like this: _“He played like the birds fly: swift and light. Suddenly the position could get frozen though, and then one would get a glimpse of the universe of variations hidden below the sky that Wu had spanned in the earlier stages”. — Jan Van der Steen on Go Seigen’s (Wu) game_

Why do I box myself in? Where do these walls come from? My immediate intuition says it is because I care too much about what others think of me, even if they have no idea who I am. But a second reason, and probably a more important one, is that I don't _love_ myself as I should. This is something I'm striving to change.

I've recently (2 or 3 months ago) started the online course [Buddhism 101](https://buddhistuniversity.net/courses/buddhism) from _The Open Buddhist University_, and one of the first few videos is a talk given by a monk called _Ajahn Brahm_ about [how to be positive](https://youtu.be/H94Dz4Iq2d4?si=cerV_tWlV1nPR48u). The talk is pretty entertaining (he is an excellent speaker and I thoroughly recommend it), and one of the things he mentions the most is the need to be kind to oneself. Listening to him made me appreciate how little kindness I show myself, how high I set the bar. Impossibly high.

While writing this I'm reminded about a passage from Ray Bradbury's excellent book [Zen in the Art of Writing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/103761.Zen_in_the_Art_of_Writing):

> [...] What are we trying to uncover in this flow? The one person irreplaceable to the world, of which there is no duplicate. You. As there was only one Shakespeare, Molière, Dr. Johnson, so you are that precious commodity, the individual man, the man we all democratically proclaim, but who, so often, gets lost, or loses himself, in the shuffle. How does one get lost? Through incorrect aims, as I have said. Through wanting literary fame too quickly. From wanting money too soon. If only we could remember, fame and money are gifts given us only after we have gifted the world with our best, our lonely, our individual truths. Now we must build our better mousetrap, heedless if a path is being beaten to our door. What do you think of the world? You, the prism, measure the light of the world; it burns through your mind to throw a different spectroscopic reading onto white paper than anyone else anywhere can throw. Let the world burn through you. Throw the prism light, white hot, on paper. Make your own individual spectroscopic reading. [...] A sense of inferiority, then, in a person, quite often means true inferiority in a craft through simple lack of experience. Work then, gain experience, so that you will be at ease in your writing, as a swimmer buoys himself in water. There is only one type of story in the world. Your story.

Interesting how the mind can sometimes dreg up forgotten _treasures_. I haven't touched this book for quite some time, and the passage refers almost directly to the feeling of _inferiority_ (as Bradbury puts it) I'm talking about. 

Experience is of course the key. But experience in _what_ is more of the question. I'm aware that my general way of communicating through the _written word_ can be improved, but that's not really it.

Maybe what has happened to my other blogs is that I fell for the trap of having _incorrect aims_ as Bradbury says. If I have to say _what_ this _""wrong aim""_ was I would say it was that of trying to fit in, of writing to please an imaginary crowd, instead of writing _my story_. 

I think that to feel _free_ while writing I need to make myself vulnerable and accept that that's a good thing. To talk about my wants and fears. Embrace my uncertainties rather than hiding them under the carpet and pretending they don't exist. 

I usually avoid talking about my emotions, telling myself I don't want to be self-pitying and that people are not really interested in reading about them. But maybe recognizing them is the first step towards self-love, and to really being able to _write as the bird flies_.

Recently I stumbled upon tiramisù's blog, and especially [this post that they recently published](https://tiramisu.bearblog.dev/100k-words/) about having reached 100k words. In the post they mention they've been following the example of another person, [Visa](https://visakanv.com/1000/), where they write _wordvomits_ without thinking too much about it. Tiramisù quotes an article by Visa which I'll reproduce here (hopefully they don't mind). 

> I recommend that you measure your progress as a writer by sheer volume of output. You WILL be a different writer at the 100,000 and 1,000,000 word marks respectively. Hell, you’ll be a totally different person.
>
> And don’t try to write well. Just write. Why? Because you can’t write well before you know what good writing is. And you can’t know what good writing is until you’ve done a lot of reading and writing.
>
> So if you want to write well, you have to let go of the perfectionistic death wish of trying to write well.
>
> Instead, accept in advance that a lot of it will suck. Embrace the suck. Make love to the suck. Don’t try to avoid it or outsmart it. Acknowledge it, face it, and get used to it. Day after day after day.

Funny how they're looking at this text in the context of _looking back_, while for me it's very relevant _looking forward_. Reading it I also get echoes from Bradbury's quote I shared above.

Maybe this will help. I realize that I have a strong perfectionist leaning and that in turn keeps me back from experimenting, exploring, and making mistakes. I force myself to stay on the _safe_ path for fear of doing anything wrong. That's what really happened to my previous blogs: I got bored of them. Stale writing is no fun.

I wont reproduce all of it here (for obvious reasons), but I wanted to comment about it a bit. You should still go ahead and read it if you have the chance! 

The article talks about the evolutionary need that humanity has had to protect themselves from being *thrown out of the tribe*, and how this has caused us to evolve a kind of *sensor* that allows us to know how to behave with our peers. This *sensor* is what Tim Urban anthropomorphizes as *The Social Survival Mammoth*, a voice that's constantly giving you feedback (aka *shit*) about yourself and how you behave.

The Mammoth will more or less work fine in situations it evolved to handle: ones where you live with a small number of people (e.g. your tribe) and would pretty much see the same faces during your whole life. You would get to know each of your peers intimately, and the coming of someone new would be quite the event. In these situations getting someone upset could be a problem because, if left to spiral out of control, you would find yourself facing the possibility of getting kicked out of the tribe and becoming a lion's afternoon snack[^maybe-still-complex]. Even lesser problems with your tribe that don't merit you being kicked out could impact your quality of life, as in not being able to find a mate, or other folks not helping you out as much.

However things have changed quite a bit since then. Now, even if the Mammoth tries to do the best job it can, it usually makes a mess of things. As Tim Urban says, society has evolved at a spectacularly faster rate than humans could ever hope to, and because of this we're still stuck with Mammoths that try to make us behave as if we were living in small tribes.

The danger of being cast out of the tribe was very real then. More than that, being cast out meant almost certain death. But in our present world that is not the case. Now, with all our technological advances, the *bare necessities* for life are easily attainable and few of us (if any) have to worry about not being able to eat, or find shelter during winter. Housing and supermarkets make it possible for us to fulfill our needs quite easily[^necessities-of-life].

Moreover, in the *modern* thunderous maelstrom of crap that we call social interaction (be it on social media or otherwise) it doesn't really matter to our own integrity if we displease someone or not. In all cases it is our perceived desire of belonging to a certain group that makes us feel like it would be *the end of the world* if we didn't meet their expectations. But the truth is that `(1)` nobody cares (at most you will be the object of some passing comments, which is unpleasant to be sure, but has no real consequences), and `(2)` if you fall out of favor with a group it is 99.8% likely that you'll find another group that you will fit in with. The other side of the coin here is that, given the diversity that's to be found in today's society, it's practically impossible to please everyone. There will be some people that vibe with you and some that don't, and some of them will vibe with each other, and that's ok.

I used to deal with this a lot growing up (and still do to some extent). I remember in my teens I felt like I had to fit in with the *cool kids*, otherwise I could say goodbye to any prospects I had in life. Reflecting back on it I can clearly see how this was my *Mammoth* talking, expressing the tribal wishes of my ancestors. I think much of my social anxiety comes from this wanting to *fit in*. 

Tim Urban posits that besides the Mammoth there's also another entity living in our head, the *Authentic Voice*. Here I quote:

> Your Authentic Voice, somewhere in there, knows all about you. In contrast to the black-and-white simplicity of the Social Survival Mammoth, your Authentic Voice is complex, sometimes hazy, constantly evolving, and unafraid. Your AV has its own, nuanced moral code, formed by experience, reflection, and its own personal take on compassion and integrity. It knows how you feel deep down about things like money and family and marriage, and it knows which kinds of people, topics of interest, and types of activities you truly enjoy, and which you don’t. Your AV knows that it _doesn’t_ know how your life will or should play out, but it tends to have a strong hunch about the right step to take next.

That is an interesting concept, and one with which I can relate very much. I know sometimes I want to do or say something but don't because of fear of how others may react. Most of the time this is just a very subtle nudge in the direction of conformity, which makes it all the more effective. Noticing these situations is probably the first step in being able to take *control* and tell my Mammoth that *""no, I don't want to sit down, I want to dance!""*. It's up to each of us to balance how much we let the Mammoth control us, and how much space we give the authentic voice to express. I would love to be able to create some more opportunities for my authentic voice to shine through.

Tim Urban's article goes on to give some steps about how to identify your Mammoth, and what to do to make it's voice less present in our mind. He does make some really good points and establishes some nice ideas for how to reduce the power your Mammoth has on you to a manageable level. But mentioning them here would mean I'll just be re-writing what he already wrote, and likely doing a poor imitation, so I think it's better for me to tell you that, once again, if you're interested you should go ahead and read [the actual article](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/06/taming-mammoth-let-peoples-opinions-run-life.html) (it even has lots of funny pictures!).

I want to close with a small thought. The 🔮 *magic* 🔮 of the internet is that you can put your thoughts our there, and the odds are that there's some part of them that will resonate with someone. We're no longer constrained by our location, no longer boxed in. According to [demandsage](https://www.demandsage.com/internet-user-statistics/)[^demandsage-trust] there are *5.3 billion* people with access to internet in the world. If we're conservative and say that *0.05%* of them will love to hear whatever it is you have say then that's about *2.6 million* possible friends! That's a lot of people. I bet it's more than the total number of people you've met in your whole life.

[^maybe-still-complex]: I was about to say that at this time the complexities of life where *few and far between*, but then decided not to. Who can really say what was going on. Maybe *drama* is a human trait?
[^necessities-of-life]: Of course here I'm talking about the average case. It is true many people around the world do suffer hunger and struggle to find shelter, and many live in what we would consider sub-human conditions.

Most of the sites I landed on are personal websites but I did stumble on some that are promotional websites trying to get you to buy something, probably submitted by some people trying to exploit the tool to increase their reach. Anyway, I guess this is understandable since manually monitoring all the links submitted to the system would be a huge undertaking.

This, and many other sites like it (as well as web rings), are trying to solve a *situation* with the small internet, one to which I've also been giving some though lately. That is, the issue of discoverability (note that this is different from the issue of *visibility*). 

I'm using *discoverability* as *how hard is for someone to randomly end up at your site*, be it through a search engine or something like *The Forest*. On the other hand, *Visibility* is *how many explicit links there are to your website* which a person would need to explicitly click to get to you. 

In the *normal* (i.e., *corporate*) web the canonical goal is to maximize visibility, which motivates the rise of highly unified mega-sites such as Facebook or Google. 

But I don't think visibility should has role in the small web.

This is mainly because of the astronomical amount of sites there are. It's impossible to be highly visible. And by consequence, being highly visible (or popular) has no real meaning besides the fact the the blog in question is *lucky*. But this fact doesn't mean it is *good* or *better* than *the competitions*, as it is often interpreted in the normal web.

Actually, the terms of *good* and *bad* are a bit misleading in the small web, since these also don't mean anything. A personal site is *good* as long as it is crafted with love and attention. It has nothing to do with **form** and **content** since each are tailored to personal aesthetics, which can't really be measured. I guess you could argue that the do (or don't) align with some status quo, but again, that doesn't mean anything.

I think the aspect of *discoverability* itself can't really be addressed in its entirety. It would be nice to have a website like *The Forest* that redirects you to a random blog, but it's unfeasible to imagine that everyone would register their site there. There are also *aggregators* like Bearblog that show you lists of the most recent posts as well as the most *popular*, but these have the important drawback that they only show info about the sites they know about (in the case of Bearblog it would be only those sites hosted there), and the *most popular* list is extremely easy to hijack.

I'm thinking a cool idea for a side project would be something like *The Forest* but besides allowing you to hop on to random blogs it also shows you the latest posts from the feed of those blogs it knows about, all aggregated in a single list. Of course, there might be a nontrivial amount of computational requirement in pulling and processing the feeds of lots of blogs, but it would still be fun!

*... shameless plug below ...*

I wrote the above a couple of weeks before publishing it, and since then it has come to my attention that there're actually many different sites that help people find other small blogs (for example, see [this list](https://sizeof.cat/post/website-discovery/)). After navigating through them for a while I'm starting to appreciate just **how many** blogs are out there, and I'm sure I haven't even seen the surface of the proverbial iceberg.

Sill, as the good software developer that I am, I just had this idea that it would be nice to create such a site, regardless of how many other such sites exists. So I went ahead and after some thinking and investigation created [Mire](https://mire.meadowing.club/), which is itself a fork[^what-is-a-fork] of the excellent [vore.website](https://vore.website/), a minimalistic RSS reader.

I basically kept the RSS reader functionalities from *vore* and on top of it added a couple more features. Most relevant to this are the [global](https://mire.meadowing.club/global) and [random](https://mire.meadowing.club/random) links at the top of the page: the former will show you a *global* feed of all the *feeds* `Mire` knows about, while the latter will send you to a random post that `Mire` has in its memory.

Some other extra features it has:

- Keep track of whether you've read a post or not
- Provides a public blogroll link that shows which blogs you're following ([example](https://mire.meadowing.club/u/meadow/blogroll))

For those interested, the code is hosted [here](https://codeberg.org/meadowingc/mire); any collaboration (or complaint) is welcome! If you want to collaborate but don't know what to do then feel free to [send me an email](/mailbox/).

[^what-is-a-fork]: For non-tech people, a *fork* is basically a copy of another project, and usually means that the first project's code was licensed in such a way that made this possible.

All the long day’s weariness is done
I’m free at last to do just as I will
Take out my pipe, admire the setting sun
Practice the art of simply sitting still
Thank God I have this briar bowl to fill,
I leave the world with all its hopeless hype,
Its pressures, and its ever-ringing till,
And let it go in smoke rings from my pipe

The hustle and the bustle, these I shun
The tasks that trouble and the cares that kill,
The false idea that there’s a race to run,
The pushing of that weary stone uphill,
The wretched i-phone’s all-insistent trill,
Whingers and whiners, each with their own gripe,
I pack them in tobacco leaves until
They’re blown away in smoke rings from my pipe

And then at last my real work is begun,
My chance to chant, to exercise the skill
Of summoning the muses, one by one,
To meet me in their temple, touch my quill
(I have a pen but quills are better still)
And when the soul is full, the time is ripe
Kindle the fire of poetry that will
Breathe and expand like smoke-rings from my pipe

Prince I have done with grinding at the mill,
These petty-pelting tyrants aren’t my type,
So lift me up and set me on a hill,
A free man blowing smoke rings from his pipe.

In case you haven't heard about it *Advent of Code* is a yearly event where every day the website releases a new programming puzzle (so an advent calendar with programming problems instead of chocolates) with the difficulty increasing the closer we get to the 25th. Puzzles are tied together by a story that you uncover with each solution. You can solve the problems however you want, you get a set of ""input data"" and need to produce an output which is often just a single value. If you like programming problems you should consider checking it out!

I've been thinking about how to approach it, which language to use, and how much time to dedicate to it. As always I have many languages I want to play with ([Gleam](https://gleam.run/), [Roc](https://www.roc-lang.org/), [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)), but I think I'll very probably be doing it with [F#](https://fsharp.org/). I'm still unsure whether I'll be doing a web-based app thing with [Fable](https://fable.io/) or a nice console app with [Spectre Console](https://spectreconsole.net/). 

On one hand, getting to know *Fable* would allow me to create web-apps with F# and the ability to interop with Javascript is pretty appealing considering the great amount of libraries it has, not to mention the code could also probably run in a NodeJS environment. Also, I'm already pretty good with making web interfaces so there's no learning involved in how to handle the input and etc. 

On the other hand, *SpectreConsole* is also very nice, and it has that modern-retro computer terminal appeal which is a great pull for me. Independently, these options are only for the *presentation layer* of the results and problem input so it doesn't really matter much. 

If done properly these two will easily be interchangeable, so I guess I can always do it with whatever's easier and then work on having a nice presentation later on. However, having a nice *platform* is appealing and I know it's something that will motivate me to keep going.

Anyway, I don't have a clear way to determine which option is better though, I think I'll just let the decision mull in the back burner and see how I feel about it once the event starts.

Considering the sharp decrease in the amount of free time I have these days (a known side effect of having a baby) I don't know how far I'll get, and I'll probably need to work on the problems at night since I expect to be pretty busy at work for the whole month of December. Still, programming puzzles are fun (for me), and thematic problems are event better!

I think I'll mainly be participating with the goal of trying to break my record. I usually do around 10 days or so before desisting. Hopefully I can do at least 11 this year.

I was thinking to myself *""wow these people are really great, they not only write very well with an extensive vocabulary and well-formed sentences, but also write engaging posts that I'm eager to continue reading""*. That is good for them I guess. But for me, I feel like I'm not good enough, I had the feeling yesterday that I should just drop it and stop kidding myself. I'm not even a native English speaker and — while I feel my vocabulary is pretty good — I can't hope to be able to express all the detailed gradations of meaning that you can only pick up from your native environment.

I'm still writing here though. I now — after sleeping on it and a healthy dose of coffee — identify these feelings as my old friend the *impostor syndrome*. It could be that I'm not as good as them. It can be that I won't ever be able to write as well as others. It could be that my content is not as engaging or free flowing as what is usually considered *good*. But even if all these are true, it is undeniable to me that *writing* is something I thoroughly enjoy doing. So if that is true, what importance do the other things even have? Who cares if I won't win prizes for painting these pictures if I enjoy my time doing them? I'm lucky enough that I don't *need* to win anything. If seen like this — with the bad parts cut off — then writing becomes an endeavor of pure enrichment: experience a pleasant time, improve at something I enjoy, get to know myself better.

This problem of not wanting to do something because of *not feeling I'm good enough* is very pervasive in my life. I always have this feeling that everything is a competition that needs to be won and if I *don't play to win* then I shouldn't play at all. This is weird, because I don't consider myself to be a very competitive person, I actually actively avoid entering a competitive mindset whenever I can avoid it. Maybe it's a byproduct of my *education* — read *cultural influences* — that makes me subconsciously behave as if everything has a *ranking*, a set of *prizes* to be competed for, that **merit** is the only thing of value there is. You end up focusing more on [collecting accomplishments](https://aco.bearblog.dev/the-subconcious-desire-to-do-more/) than doing the thing itself.

The worst part of this is that I don't believe I need to *be the best*, but I do feel I should *do my best*. This is a completely toxic attitude though, because it makes you — subtly, almost imperceptibly — take on a competitive mindset. You become unable to do things just for fun unless it's a solitary, isolated thing. Something that you won't show to anyone else. And I don't think this isolation good. I want to be able to *wholeheartedly* share things with others, using the complete meaning of the word.

I try not to fall into this trap of feeling I need to compete. I really do. But, right now, I think this is a way in which my mind works. Trying to dismantle it — as I've been doing lately with *writing* — is hard and requires seeing what *metrics* am I judging myself with and seeing (rather than questioning) how coarse they are, how completely they miss the point. I can only hope that these efforts have ramifications in other areas of my life. I can only hope to slowly become more open to accept myself and stop comparing with others. I can only hope I stop caring about the unimportant things.

But it's all a process I guess. A path that should be walked, one step at the time.

I thought I wasn't going to get much time to write today, considering all the family meetups and whatnot. But my son is having a nap right now and I stayed with him in the car while my wife went and helped with the preparations. I think she knew I needed some time to prepare to go through the coming afternoon.

I've been giving some though about why sometimes I feel like I'm inferior to others in some way. And I think this feeling acts on different levels.

For example, I have pretty good confidence in myself as a programmer, and even feel comfortable talking to others about this topic. Supposing the conversation revolves around technology, and that I don't need to insert myself in that conversation to begin with, I know I can participate at great lengths with little to no discomfort.

Ah, but if we're talking about smalltalk then we're in problems. Smalltalk, [the bane of my existence](https://reverie.bearblog.dev/small-talk/). It's somewhat ironic though. If there's someone I don't know then I have no problems talking to them for a moderate amount of time. But if I do know them then I start worrying that maybe they're not interested in what I have to say. This is even more noticeable if the person in question is a family member I rarely see, and worse still if it's someone from my wife's side of the family.

In very extreme cases I find myself changing how I talk so as to try and *please* that person. This makes me go through great lengths to try and discern what that person wants to hear, what they want to talk about, and (most importantly) the reactions they have to what I'm saying. This becomes very taxing over time, and not enjoyable at all. I feel absolutely drained when this happens for an extended period, and end up feeling like I'm socially inept and hopeless, with my self-esteem on the floor.

For all the effort I put into being authentic on here (which I have to say I've been able to do with a modicum of success), what comes out of my mouth when I speak is anything but. This only exacerbates the problem when I imagine how others might be noticing this as we talk. 

Even when exchanging emails with someone (which you might have noticed if we've chatted via email), I worry about being a nice person and often end up writing in a convoluted and garbled way.

I have a brother who is very outgoing, and one of the few people in my life I can honestly say I can talk authentically to (the others being my wife, and perhaps my parents (sometimes)). I once told him about this problem in passing and he laughed and thought I was joking. He dismissed the comment saying *""that's awful! No one feels like they're worthless and have nothing to contribute to a conversation""*. He, of course, has had the luck not to have to deal with depression and social anxiety. It's overstated, but I haven't brought up the topic again since then.

When I think about how to get more confident socially I think of how to improve my smalltalk skills. This has brought me to read books such as [How to win friends and influence people](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4865.How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People), and observe how others go about it. 

Of all my efforts (which to be honest have been half-hearted at best) the main insight I've gained is that people just say whatever they want as long as it is slightly related to what the other person said (and often without even listening to what was said to begin with). Just speaking their minds, in a most literal sense.

That's weird to me. When I imagine a great conversator I think of someone who pays close attention to the other person, listens and responds with empathy, and provides insightful comments and promptings. 

... Now that I say it out loud, it sounds like I'm describing a therapist ...

Maybe what I need to do here, as in most other areas of my life, is to stop worrying about it so much and instead be less cautious; just speak my mind with little care for those listening, vomit my thoughts out there without any regards for the effects they might have. Ahh, those truly sound like the traits of a great conversator.

Just kidding. I'm sure this can be done in a thoughtful manner while respecting my own integrity and other's attention. But I need some humor to get me through the coming bout of holiday smalltalk.

Anyway. Happy holidays! Wishing you luck in your own uncomfortable situations 🌱

I tell myself this is likely a common cultural phenomenon where we're pushed to *make goods* all the time. I feel like not doing so is immoral, and a flaw in my own personality. 

But I have no real way to know if other people feel the same. Do they also tend to feel restless if they don't have an aim to work towards? Can they just *not do anything* and feel good about it? 

If I look within myself I notice that this feeling is composed of two different *tributaries*: the lesser one is the feeling that not doing anything is somehow morally wrong. And the most pressing one (which is possibly just another facet of the first) is that if I have *precious* free time and I don't do anything then I'm *wasting* it. 

I then ask myself *""am I really wasting it if I want to do nothing?""*, which is invariably followed by the much more insidious question *""do I really want to do nothing?""*. 

I don't know. I've even made a list of the things I like and enjoy so that when I have free time I pick one of the items to keep myself entertained. But still my time frequently feels empty, unsatisfying. My mind questioning whether I'm taking advantage of the opportunity as much as I should. 

I've always associated this feeling with the need to be productive, and feeling like I'm doing something worthwhile with my time. And, I think, therein lies the problem: I don't have any metric to know how worthwhile an activity is. 

Reading the last sentence again it almost seems silly. Isn't your enjoyment of whatever you're doing enough validation for the value of an action? I guess it is. I have the tendency to get in the way of my own happiness by wondering if what makes me happy is praiseworthy or not.

Again I see it. Who am I looking to receive praise from? Is it my family? Friends? Internet strangers? Is it myself? 

As my therapist would say, ""*you need to get out of the way and let yourself just enjoy what you're doing instead of second guessing*"". 

Right now my thoughts are telling me *""how can I say **that**, when many people in the world don't have any free time at all, and many have much worse living conditions than you?""*. Which only makes me feel worse. It feels petty to think and write about this, but I can't do anything about them, and surely my appreciation of my own time won't affect them in any way. Still, thinking about others does help put things into perspective.

Some of my earliest memories of my grandmother are of her sitting crocheting in front of the TV (which was so loud you were almost unable to hear your own thoughts). I remember asking her many times if she could teach me, it looked so fun and I loved the idea of being able to create things I could then wear, or even small plushies. But I never managed to get her to teach me. 

She always answered me with a variation of *""You're a boy and crocheting is for ladies. Go play outside, or read a book instead. If you still want to learn when you're older I will teach you""*.  Yes, she was very *conservative* in that way, and believed that me crocheting would somehow corrupt my little innocent soul. Old ways of thinking I guess, she later changed her views and ended up accepting queer people as normal *people* instead of problems that needed to be fixed, but that's another topic. 

Alas, my grandmother passed away without me ever re-asking her to impart her crocheting wisdom after I became an adult. I've tried looking at tutorials online but I constantly failed to understand them, and quickly got disheartened — what the hell does *""half single crochet stitch""* even mean? 

My wife has known this has been something I've wanted to do for a while so around 2 months ago she gifted me a *crocheting kit for beginners*! It had everything I needed to learn in the form of hooks, a great yarn that was easy to work with, and (more importantly) a set of videos that I had to watch in order that taught me most of the different types of stitches and then walked me through making my own plushie wale.

The wale ended up being more a ball with fins, but still, I now feel like I can at least understand other YouTube videos and I'm ready to tackle (slightly) more complex projects!

When we're faced with such a situation we frequently tell ourselves that if we only had more information we could certainty make the *proper* decision. But life does not work like that. Sometimes there is no *right* or *wrong* to a situation, sometimes it's impossible to forsee the consequences from your current vantage point. 

This happens for both big and small things. What choice of shirt I wear today might not have much impact in my overall life, while choosing which city I want to live in will definitely have unforeseeable ramifications for both my life and my self-identity. Even a smaller thing like deciding whether to check-in with that long lost friend might open up all sets of possibilities that we can't even fathom. After all, humans are notoriously bad at perceiving the future, or even making plans beyond what they'll eat today - and even then things don't always go according to plan. 

It is easy to get bogged down in collecting facts, determining pros and cons, weighing them, and in general losing lots of headspace. It's hard to accept that there is no perfect answer. 

So, when faced with such a situation, don't panic and cheer up in the knowledge that whatever you choose will be ok, just do whatever your gut tells you to do. 

After all, what is a *sure decision* besides something we've told ourselves we have enough *partial knowledge* to judge correctly?

I feel anonymity helps with creativity so forgive me if I don't share any details besides some basic stuff: he/him, 30.

I'm a software engineer by profession, and right now I'm part of a team exploring the use of LLMs to enrich real-time human interactions, especially in service scenarios.

Occasionally given to bouts of poetic nonsense, usually trying to capture some fleeting feeling or sensation. I write mainly about random thoughts, poetry, and for a while now I have also been trying to get myself into writing short stories.  

As for my hobbies: I play the flute, writing, reading, learning languages, and make the occasional small game (more often than not with [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php)). In general I like to tinker around with stuff. When I have the chance I like to walk around in nature. 

I've always thought that knowing someone's favorite writers allows you to glimpse quite a bit about that person. Here are some of mine in no particular order: Terry Pratchett, Tolkien, Patrick Rothfuss, Brandon Sanderson, Ursula K. Le Guin, Ray Bradbury, Robert Jordan. 

I first heard of **Bear** on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) quite some time ago and was immediately attracted by the whole idea and the concept of _little web_. 

I've always wanted to have a blog, and at the time I had just created one on [Substack](https://substack.com/), thinking that a polished, full-featured platform would help me towards my goal. I wrote some posts on there but soon started paying attention to all the _social_ features, and their whole _""make money while writing""_ thing. I eventually stopped writing altogether, mainly out of feeling of intimidation with the platform, feeling I wasn't doing what it wanted me to do. I was subconsciously forcing myself to write with a style and content that I thought would fit well.

After a while I decided to try out my hand at blogging once again, but this time I was going to create my own blog. I spent some time studying different options and at the end chose to use the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) site generator mainly because of its flexibility and community support.

I had a lot of fun building the actual site/web-app, but after some months of working on it I found myself with what amounted to be a clone of Substack. It looked exactly the same, and I was still forcing myself to write the same kind of content. I also probably spent more time tweaking stuff on the website than actually writing. 

Something nice that both Substack and Bear have is a community, which is something that you don't get when creating your own site. On these platforms, even if nobody reads your stuff, it's nice to know that they're there if anyone wants to read them. I feel this is motivating, and offers some sense of accountability. But when writing on your own self-hosted blog it's virtually impossible for someone to find it unless you spend some time promoting yourself on social media, which I wasn't too keen on doing. 

So here we are again on Bear, and this time I've actually decided to make a page, a fresh start on a platform that is so simple it doesn't _get in the way_ but also doesn't force you in any way.

Anyway, its nice to meet you!

I've had it in my list of things to watch for a looooong time now, but I always shy away from it, subconsciously avoiding it. I don't know why. I think I've always wanted to write stories which is something I used to do a lot of when I was a kid, but now I'm kind of [afraid of trying and finding out I suck](https://tiramisu.bearblog.dev/destiny-avoided/). I wouldn't even know where to start from, but I guess I'm just making problems for myself. In the past what has worked is I just pick an idea and start writing. I sometimes used to get this wonderful thing where I felt that I wasn't really *writing*, I wasn't doing anything, the story was just flowing from my hand, through my pen, to the paper, sort of like a metal rod conducting lighting. 

I still feel unsure, but maybe going through the course will help in some way. At the very least hearing one of my favorite authors talk about his process and his problems is sure to keep me inspired and hopeful! I have a feeling that continuing with my [morning pages](/morning-pages/) is also an excellent way to help lift up the dam I've built around my mind.

For example, at night when I'm falling asleep — or even at random moments during the day when I'm not doing any *intellectual* work — I have so many ideas of things to write. It's like a spring of freshwater moving from my subconscious to my conscious awareness. But when I try to actually write the ideas falter, they stutter. I try to grasp the tail of one as it quickly hides under a rock, and come back only with smoke in my hands. I say it's the idea that hides, but more likely it's me, hiding the idea away from myself, for some reason. This is what I meant when I say *""lift up the dam""*!

Not so much that the ideas themselves are good (all ideas are the same as far as I'm concerned) it's more that I'm excited about that particular thing, itching to write it down, thinking how much fun I'll have doing so and how it might even be helpful or interesting to someone.

There is an idea I keep coming back to again and again, which is *how do you maintain excitement about a topic or story after the initial fever*. I wonder if professional writers actually manage to retain whatever touched them about a story while they go through the whole thing, or whether they have to force themselves to write and good things come out. If you know an answer to this then [I would love to hear about it](/mailbox/)!

I remember reading somewhere in the cornucopia of creative inspiration that is [Zen in the Art of Writing](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/d1b6b6f6-54d7-4695-83cf-7d03564f846f) that *pinning the initial excitement to the page* is an ability that can be learned and cultivated, but still requires you to write down the important things *in the moment* so that you can then come back to them later.

I've tried to do that but usually what happens when I revisit the idea is that I just think *meh* and move on. The idea stops being exciting, the mental fermentation that spawned it has stopped or moved to something else.

Whenever I'm making a post for my blog I usually write the first (and often final, with some minor modifications) draft in one writing spurt. It's very rare for me to publish something that takes more than one writing session (although I have done so, most recently with [The Asphirinx](/the-asphirinx/)).

One of the joys of having a blog is that I can literally write about anything that catches my fancy. There is no need for me to squeeze out words about a topic I don't feel an affinity with. And if I stop enjoying a blog post then I'll just ditch it. There're no obligations of any kind.

While nice, maybe this freedom will at the same time keep me from **having** to work on strengthening the neural pathways that would allow me to recover my original sense of excitement about something.

At the same time, I write because I like it, I enjoy the time I spend on it. I'm sure that forcing myself would dilute some of this joy, and that's not something I want.

I don't know why. The emotion I feel towards the idea of sharing this with them is *shame*. And that's just telling them of the act. Actually having them read it is positively terrifying. I've had this feeling for a while now actually, that writing is something to be done in the dark, when no one is seeing.

Looking deeper I think it's because I'm afraid of them reading my stuff and then realizing I'm no good, and making fun of me in some way. I feel this most especially with my wife (which is weird since she, and everyone else close to me, has been nothing but supportive with whatever it is I want to do), but it's still present, to a lesser extent, with everyone else I can think of. Even with internet stranger — although you are at the end of the spectrum. Still, that's probably the reason why I haven't shared any stories online.

In my early twenties I got into meditating quite a bit, and was a *fan* of Buddhist literature. I was — and still am — impressed by their whole view of the mind. Growing up a Christian (who later became an atheist) it was a whole revelation, a new way of thinking about good and bad, about happiness and sadness.

Anyway, I'm digressing. What I wanted to talk about is that at this point — I must have been around 21 or so — I felt ashamed of people (and again, especially my wife) seeing me meditate. I would even go to such extents such as locking myself in the room before sitting *on the cushion*. I can only wonder what it was she thought I was doing. 

It always struck me as interesting. Nowadays I still meditate (less than I would like) but no longer feel any shame about it. Although there was a moment when I had to go through the transition. I would work up my courage to tell her *I'm going to meditate* and she would just say *go for it* or some such. I don't think she ever realized that it was a big deal for me to deal with the uncomfortable-ness of having her in the room with me. Our minds can be quirky sometimes.

Maybe I should take the same approach with writing and just *bite the bullet* as they say. Although I don't think I'm strong enough. At least not yet.

Some of it I've crafted myself, a fact on which I take a generous pinch of pride and pleasure, and others have been graciously given to me by others, the fruits of their own efforts freely shared. The only interaction with other (human) intelligences happens through small windows — websites, blogs, the odd micro-blog, emails — enough to not feel alone, but we're still each in our own virtual submarine, looking out at the sky through our personal collection of periscopes. 

I don't mind that it's this way, I actually enjoy the separation, the allowance it gives to talk about things of the soul and the heart, to say things I wouldn't dare say in my *real* life. 

What initially seems as separation bringing us closer than we would ever be if we were to meet *out there*.

In it we follow Miyazaki-san in a pretty intimate way as he goes through his creative process and I was completely floored by the fact that he spends so much time not really knowing what to do. 

We think of him (and of many other famous creators) as just this fountain of interminable ideas with perfect execution, but the truth shown in the documentary is that this is not the whole story. We only every see their final output, but we miss the huge amount of work they put into creating their marvels. 

In the documentary we see Miyazaki spending whole days just driving around, or not doing much (as far as production goes), just trying to get some inspiration about what to do next. He then spends days just struggling through the creative process, ditching sketch after sketch into the waste basket. 

As someone who doesn't really understand creative processes and is considerably intimidated by the *great ones*, I found this part of the documentary extremely inspiring and eye-opening. Sure, these people are talented, but it's the sweat and persistence they put in that makes them truly special. The thing they have in common is that they don't give up, as [Visa](https://visakanv.com/) says in his essay [when the vision isn’t manifesting](https://visakanv.substack.com/p/when-the-vision-isnt-manifesting) (which is where I got the link to Miyazaki's documentary in the first place).

I just finished the first of the four 45 min episodes, where he has already gotten some steam and is steadily producing stuff for one of his movies ([Ponyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponyo)), with the occasional hiccup here and there. But still, it's clear how much effort it takes him to go forward, even if he is a creative genius.

I'm looking forward to finish watching the whole documentary. If any other interesting things comes up I'll be sure to write about them here!

Recently I published [a post](/on-work-journaling-and-authentic-writing/) about how I wanted to write stuff I *feel* about. However, since then I've struggled to actually sit down to write, thinking any idea I come up with is not *good enough*. I told myself that I wasn't digging deep enough. But of course, you can never satisfy that inner critic, so an endless spiral of self-rejection ensued.

It took me a while to realize that by stating these goals I had constructed a *moat* for myself. It makes me feel safe, validated, justified, but at the same time it prevents me from going out there and smelling the flowers. 

It may be that these goals are the destination towards which I want to travel, but holding myself accountable to those standards since the beginning is futile. I want freedom, and it shouldn't be traded for safety, comfort, nor structure. 

This is all I wanted to say in this post. It's more a justification to myself. I guess it's part of the learning process. 

The takeaway: don't aim to high, especially when you don't know where the sky is.

Going forwards I'll try to be more sensible and allow myself to write about random stuff. 

I mentioned in [another recent post](/finding-my-own-feet/) about a new concept for me, the idea of *wordvomit*, which has lately been going around in my mind. I think perhaps the correct path is to adapt that idea by not *forcing* myself to write about topics I have feelings about, and instead to flip this perverse idea on its head and learn to dig up my feelings when writing about **any** topic. 

I said I wasn't going to write about *mundane* stuff, but that's not correct. I have the feeling that with enough skill and acceptance any topic can become sacred, a true reflection of a facet within yourself.

Hi! This is my journal page... I tend to try to write these as [Morning Pages](/morning-pages/) and they're mostly stream of consciousness. These are all very minimally edited entries so expect for them to be fairly rough. The only editing I've consciously done is obscure people and location names, and sometimes cut off sections to preserve privacy (mine or people I talk about).

Beautiful flowers are not for the faint of heart
nor are they for the madman who lives his life apart.
Constant worry is the norm of our days
Endlessly burning our spirits away.

How can we enjoy the beautiful flowers if we leave no space for joy? 
How can we drink of the great mother's milk when our own cup is full
full to the brim of sludge, murky and dark?

Better to empty our cups, and so have it full.
Better yet to throw it away and through our roots
draw up the sweet sap that nourishes our soul. 

Descend the perilous stairs, one by one
and find at the end that the only true peril
was not to step through the entrance at all.

For only from pain can true growth come
so take your fuel and let it propel you forwards
towards wonders untold.

I like writing poetry, or at least in a _poetical way_. There's something really satisfying and freeing about the medium and the few constraints it imposes. I worry that what I write is not proper poetry, but at the same time I really don't care. More and more I'm learning to appreciate that what I do is perfect for what it is. I'm not trying to be someone else or get acceptance into someone else's ""club."" Or at least that's what I know I should aim for. For that way, aligning myself with external metrics, lies the way of danger; that way is past the _cave's_ entrance.
